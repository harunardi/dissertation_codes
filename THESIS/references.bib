  abstract = {This paper presents a so-called neutron noise simulator, essentially an algorithm to calculate the dynamic transfer function, and its use in a procedure allowing to locate a noise source from the neutron detector readings. The noise simulator relies on the twogroup diffusion approximation in 2-D. Benchmarking of this calculator versus analytical solutions showed that the finite difference discretisation scheme used in the simulator was accurate in case of homogeneous cores and a central noise source. The localisation algorithm was found to give correct results as long as one single noise source exists in the core and when the transfer function from the removal cross-section noise to the thermal neutron noise was used. Applying this localisation procedure to the Forsmark-1 BWR (Sweden) when a local instability event occurred (cycle 16) pointed out, via the use of an appropriate set of detectors, a region close to where an unseated fuel element was discovered.},

The theory includes delayed neutrons. The correlation function and the power spectral density for the detection rate, as well as for the neutron density, have been obtained. The application of the general theory to simple reactor models has been discussed and illustrated by considering the one-speed transport and one-speed diffusion approximations. The connection between Langevin's technique and the doublet theory based on the Liouville equation has been established. It has been found that both formulations yield identical results and that the postulates of Langevin's technique are justified for the study of neutron distributions.},

  abstract = {The application of the Langevin equation method to the study of fluctuations in the space- and velocity-dependent neutron density as well as in the detector outputs in nuclear reactors is presented. In this case, the Langevin equation is the stochastic linear neutron transport equation with a space- and velocity-dependent random neutron source, often referred to as the noise equivalent source (NES). The power spectral densities (PSDs) of the NESs in the transport equation, as well as in the accompanying detection rate equations, are obtained, and the cross- and auto-power spectral densities of the outputs of pairs of detectors are explicitly calculated. The transport-level expression for the R({$\omega$}) ratio measured in the 252Cf source-driven noise analysis method is also derived. Finally, the implementation of the Langevin equation approach at different levels of approximation is discussed, and the stochastic one-speed transport and one-group P1 equations are derived by first integrating the stochastic transport equation over speed and then eliminating the angular dependence by a spherical harmonics expansion. By taking the large transport rate limit in the P1 description, the stochastic diffusion equation is obtained as well as the PSD of the NES in it. This procedure also leads directly to the stochastic Fick's law.},

Nuclear politics is highly relevant to understanding the nature of the post-Suharto state in relation to ongoing contemporary democratic transitions.

  abstract = {Indonesia has been ambitious with its efforts to tackle climate change and achieve net zero carbon emission. This is reflected by the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that has been defined by the Government and presented during the Copenhagen Accord, Paris Agreement, and Glasgow Climate Pact. In realization, Indonesia has also pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2060, especially in the energy sector. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR/KESDM) of Indonesia has published its plan to achieve said targets through diversification and intensification of new and renewable energy resources. New and renewable energy bill is also currently being discussed in Indonesia's House of Representative (DPR-RI). However, the reality is that the country is facing several challenges in meeting its targets, and the plans and targets set by the government in the energy sector are not being achieved. In this paper, we analyze the factors that have hindered the implementation of Indonesia's energy transition plan and suggest potential solutions for filling the gaps. To achieve the NDC, we suggest that Indonesia must identify new resources and intensify the use of existing resources. Additionally, the paper provides recommendations on energy market policy that can help to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. This paper would provide a future outlook on Indonesia's energy policy and energy market. by adopting new energy technologies, increasing investment in renewable energy, and developing policies that support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our analysis highlights the importance of addressing the challenges faced by Indonesia's energy sector and the need for a comprehensive strategy that takes into account the complex interplay of factors that affect the energy transition process.},

  abstract = {Diffusion approximation is an important approximation used to model a nuclear reactor core with a quite good accuracy and less computational cost. This approximation has been used widely around the globe for various kinds of nuclear reactors. This diffusion approximation is applied in a two-step method, a method combining a high fidelity transport code and low fidelity diffusion code. Meanwhile, innovations in the nuclear core model continue to make the nuclear reactor core safer, more robust, and smaller. The trend of creating smaller and more modular reactor core is emerging in the last ten years. These innovations will affect the core modeling system. Consequently, for smaller reactors, it is important to evaluate the capability of diffusion approximation if one wants to use a computationally cheaper method to model the reactor core. In this paper, neutron diffusion calculation for 160 MWth integral pressurized water reactor (IPWR) core was conducted using the PARCS nodal diffusion code employing the few-group spatially homogenized cross-sections generated by the Serpent Monte Carlo code. Due to its capability to model any reactor geometry in the high-resolution calculation, the results from Serpent were also used as a reference. Two important parameters are compared between PARCS and Serpent: effective neutron multiplication factor and core power distribution. For the full IPWR core model, a discrepancy of 564 pcm between PARCS and Serpent keff was observed, while the radial power distribution had a maximum error of 4.71 \%. It can be said, to some extent, that the diffusion approximation can be applied to IPWR core analysis. However, further improvement is indeed required if one wants more accurate results with low computational costs.},

  abstract = {The significant recent advances in computer speed and memory have made possible an increasing fidelity and accuracy in reactor core simulation with minimal increase in the computational burden. This has been important for modeling some of the smaller advanced reactor designs for which simplified approximations such as few groups homogenized diffusion theory are not as accurate as they were for large light water reactor cores. For narrow cylindrical cores with large surface to volume ratios such the Ped Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), neutron leakage from the core can be significant, particularly with the harder neutron spectrum and longer mean free path than a light water reactor. In this paper the core from the OECD PBMR-400 benchmark was analyzed using multigroup Monte Carlo cross sections in the HTR reactor core simulation code AGREE. Homogenized cross sections were generated for each of the discrete regions of the AGREE model using a full core SERPENT Monte Carlo model. The cross sections were generated for a variety of group structures in AGREE to assess the importance of finer group discretization on the accuracy of the core eigenvalue and flux predictions compared to the SERPENT full core Monte Carlo solution. A significant increase in the accuracy was observed by increasing the number of energy groups, with as much as a 530 pcm improvement in the eigenvalue calculation when increasing the number of energy groups from 2 to 14. Significant improvements were also observed in the AGREE neutron flux distributions compared to the SERPENT full core calculation.},

Integral PWR using MOX fuel can be used as solution to handle electrification problem in archipelagic nations as well as to accomodate the transition of fuel from UO2 to MOX. Integral PWR is a modular nuclear power plant with 160 MWt for each module. Recently, Integral PWR use UO2 fuel as the main fuel. This research's purpose is to determine the change of reactor core performance from UO2 into MOX. This research is done by varying PuO2 ratio in MOX, number of fuel, and type of fuel cladding using SRAC2006 code system. Parametric study is done by observing value of keff, conversion ratio, and actinide inventory, as well as by comparing with UO2 fuel reactor core. Result shows that performance of reactor core using MOX is better than UO2 reactor core. The most optimum design of Integral PWR is using 12\% PuO2 in MOX fuel, core diameter 165 cm, and Zircalloy-4 cladding. This can be observed from period of criticality of reactor core up to 1521 days with lowest CR is 0,622004. Excess reactivity of this reactor core is lower than UO2 fuel design (1,07745932 compared with 1,1035821). Actinide produced by this core shows declining trend during reactor operation.},

Belum adanya penelitian mengenai PWR Integral dengan menggunakan bahan bakar MOX  membuat penelitian ini penting untuk dilakukan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui perubahan performa neutronik teras reaktor dari yang sebelumnya menggunakan bahan bakar UO2 menjadi MOX. Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan cara mengubah rasio PuO2 dalam MOX, jumlah bahan bakar, jenis kelongsong, tebal reflektor, dan jenis reflektor. Faktor-faktor yang diperhatikan adalah nilai kekritisan (keff), rasio konversi, jumlah aktinida, fuel temperature coefficient (FTC), moderator temperature coefficient (MTC), dan void coefficient (VC), juga dilakukan perbandingan dengan teras reaktor benchmark. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan performa teras reaktor dengan menggunakan bahan bakar MOX lebih baik daripada UO2. Hal ini dilihat dari periode kekritisan teras reaktor yang mencapai 1521 hari dengan nilai rasio konversi paling rendah adalah 0,622004. Excess reactivity yang dimiliki juga lebih rendah yaitu 1,0745932 dimana desain awal bernilai 1,1035821. Aktinida yang dihasilkan juga mengalami tren penurunan seiring reaktor beroperasi. Nilai FTC, MTC, VC yang dihasilkan selalu bernilai negatif baik di awal, tengah, atau akhir operasi reaktor. nilai FTC terendah terjadi saat awal operasi reaktor dengan nilai -3,83211 pcm/K, nilai MTC terendah terjadi di tengah operasi reaktor dengan nilai -32,3523 pcm/K, nilai VC terendah terjadi saat akhir operasi reaktor dengan nilai -151,982 pcm/\% void.},

The measurements recorded flux at several detector locations outside the core while reactivity insertions of varying scale were conducted. The results provide valuable data to explore point and 3D reactor models. Inverse point-kinetics analyses of the recorded flux indicate that delayed parameters tabulated by only the fission-rate per nuclide provide similar results to adjoint-weighted kinetics parameters calculated by MCNP6 via the iterated fission probability method, on the timescale of delayed neutrons. However, the inadequacy of the conventional delayed photoneutron parameters, which are based on measurements of uranium-235 in D2O, is clearly shown in the computed reactivity. The importance of delayed photoneutrons in heavy water reactor kinetics necessitates an improved understanding of the delayed photoneutron group structure by nuclide and appropriate adjoint-weighting for photoneutrons.},

Unfortunately, since such an analysis belongs to the non-linear ``parametric excitation'' realm, its theoretical aspects and relations have been mostly carried out after linearization.

This method is then applied to the single mode random fluctuations of the absorption cross sections in a power reactor which is modelled by the multigroup diffusion equation with multiple delayed neutron groups. A system of coupled pseudo steady state diffusion equations has been derived as the result. The procedure of numerically solving such a system, using the Finite Element Method is described and the previously reported GFEM code, which is a Galerkin FEM based diffusion solver and Linear Power Reactor Noise analyzer for two dimensional geometries, has been generalized to accommodate the LEM to evaluate the higher order power reactor noise moments. Use of these moments in the Power Spectral Density of the flux and its derivatives, such as the detection rate, has shown that the value of the PSD at the main harmonic of the fluctuation deviates with the predictions of the conventional LPRN method. Moreover, the generation of super-harmonic modes in the PSD of the neutron flux distribution has been shown to follow naturally by using the developed LEM. Three numerical benchmarks show the correctness and accuracy of the developed method. Finally, the error introduced in the linearization process is quantified by comparing numerical results of the LPRN method with that of the LEM, and some of the general trends of this error have been identified. As a result, the expectation of validity of the linearization process in the ``sufficiently small perturbation'' region is confirmed.},

  abstract = {The telegrapher's theory was used to develop a new formulation for the neutron noise equation. Telegrapher's equation is supposed to demonstrate a more realistic approximation for neutron transport phenomena, especially in comparison to the diffusion theory. The physics behind such equation implies that the signal propagation speed is finite, instead of the infinite as in the case of ordinary diffusion. This paper presents the theory and results of the development of a new method for calculation of the neutron noise using the telegrapher's equation as its basis. In order to investigate the differences and strengths of the new method against the diffusion based neutron noise, a comparison was done between the behaviors of two methods. The neutron noise based on SN transport considered as a precision measuring point. The Green's function technique was used to calculate the neutron noise based on telegrapher's and diffusion methods as well as the transport. The amplitude and phase of Green's function associated with the properties of the medium and frequency of the noise source were obtained and their behavior was compared to the results of the transport. It was observed, the differences in some cases might be considerable. The effective speed of propagation for the noise perturbations were evaluated accordingly, resulting in considerable deviations in some cases.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to explore the significance of transport theory in neutron noise, localization of a noise source by Green's function based on transport theory is investigated. There are considerable differences between Green's functions based on diffusion and transport, such as small dimensions, near edges, high heterogeneity medium and high-frequency source of perturbation. These differences are expected to significantly impact unfolding, reconstruction, and identification of the neutron noise source. Improvement in noise source unfolding methods is essential in terms of safety aspects and reactor performance enhancement. Since gaining the ability to monitor nuclear reactor based on noise diagnostics principle using few numbers of detectors is a challenging problem, more accurate methods of calculation of neutron noise can help reduce the detectors in number and sensitivity to location. This study revealed that inverse Green's function based on diffusion and transport is fundamentally different in concept. The inverse Green's function based on diffusion theory requires applying complicated reconstruction methods to gain more accurate results. This means that a large number of detectors must be used for noise source reconstruction. In contrast, in the case of inverse Green's function based on transport theory, each mesh's shape function is strongly correlated with the adjacent mesh. As a result, simple methods can be used to reconstruct the noise source. Therefore, the noise source can be identified and reconstructed with a smaller number of detectors in practical terms.},

  abstract = {The inverse kinetics method, is a method to calculate a reactor's reactivity profile from its power profile. In this thesis, the reactivity profile corresponding to pulse operations of the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) was sought. Of specific interest was the shutdown reactivity of the reactor following the pulse. This required accounting for delayed beryllium photoneutrons that are present in the ACRR in addition to U-235 delayed neutron precursors. The power profiles of the pulses were experimentally measured using a diamond photoconductive detector (PCD). Using the inverse kinetics equation, a computer code was written to numerically calculate the reactivity corresponding to the PCD signal. It was found that the PCD's signal was only proportional to the reactor power before and during a pulse. Following a pulse, the PCD lost this proportionality because its response became dominated by fission product and activation gamma rays. Attempts were made to subtract the unwanted gamma ray contribution from the PCD signal. This allowed the reactivity to be roughly determined for tens of seconds following the pulse before the signal strength became too low.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation is the ``gold standard'' for particle transport problems emerging in radiation shielding, reactor physics, criticality safety and nuclear instrumentation. Reference solutions with almost no approximations can be obtained, at the expense of high computational cost, which can then be used for the numerical validation of faster but approximate deterministic solvers. The development of novel variance reduction strategies and the increased availability of HPC resources has enormously widened the field of application for Monte Carlo simulations, covering non-stationary regimes with multiphysics feedback, and previously inaccessible observables. In this PhD thesis we will illustrate how particle-tracking algorithms, which lie at the heart of Monte Carlo methods, should evolve in order to cope with these new challenges. We will first review the existing particle-tracking strategies, based on the standard piece-wise-constant medium description, and examine their merits and drawbacks. Then, we will extend these methods to the case of random media and continuously-varying media, each involving specific challenges. For the case of continuously-varying media, which is the main focus of this thesis, we will show that negative weighted delta tracking is highly effective, in that it does not require a strict majorant cross section (contrary to regular delta tracking). In order to overcome the possible instabilities due to the presence of negative-weighted particles in this algorithm, we will develop and successfully test exact and approximate weight cancellation techniques. Finally, by building on these findings, we will show that weight cancellation can also be key to achieving convergence and greatly reducing the statistical uncertainty in neutron noise problems.},

Additional measurements of the subcritical configuration of the fully loaded core, core excess reactivity, shutdown margins, six isothermal temperature coefficients, and axial reaction-rate distributions were also evaluated as acceptable benchmark experiments. Insufficient information is publicly available to develop finely detailed models of the HTTR as much of the design information is still proprietary. The uncertainties in the benchmark models are judged to be of sufficient magnitude to encompass any biases and bias uncertainties incurred through the simplification process used to develop the benchmark models. However, use of the benchmark critical configurations of the HTTR for nuclear data adjustment is not recommended as the impact of these biases has not been addressed with rigorous detail. The impact of any simplification biases, if any, is not expected to significantly impact evaluation of the other reactor physics measurement calculations. Dominant uncertainties in the experimental keff for all core configurations come from uncertainties in the impurity content of the various graphite blocks that compose the HTTR. Monte Carlo calculations of keff are between *0.9\% and *2.7\% greater than the benchmark values. Reevaluation of the HTTR models as additional information becomes available could improve the quality of this benchmark and possibly reduce the computational biases. High-quality characterization of graphite impurities would significantly improve the quality of the HTTR benchmark assessment. Simulations of the other reactor physics measurements are in good agreement with the benchmark experiment values. The complete benchmark evaluation details are available in the 2014 edition of the International Handbook of Evaluated Reactor Physics Benchmark Experiments.},

An important part of the CORTEX project deals with code development and validation. In this paper, a new methodology for the simulation of neutron noise has been formulated and implemented in the APOLLO3 code. In the first part of this paper, the experimental setup and the methodology for the experimental data analysis developed by CEA are presented. The experimental outcomes are reported in terms of Cross-Power Spectral Densities (CPSD) of detector responses. The results produced with CEA analysis are compared to those obtained by EPFL. The second part of the work presents the noise simulator based on an improved point-kinetics model employed in a fully heterogeneous 2D transport calculation including its theoretical derivation. The computed results, i.e. the temporal signals of the detector responses, are treated to recover the CPSDs to be compared to the experimental ones. In the third part of the work, the paper presents a series of interpretive exercises performed with the IPK noise model aiming at showing its simulation capabilities and at trying to address some of the discrepancies observed in the direct comparison. Beside the promising outcomes of the simulations, some work is still being done from the experimental and computational side for a better comprehension of the problem before the extension of the model to full 3D problems and industrial application.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, the stability of xenon oscillations is estimated by solution of the timedependent neutron diffusion equation, coupled with iodine and xenon equations, by finding out the damping ratios in each case. This is performed for different initial perturbations and core burnup conditions and is a very time-consuming and tedious process. Some earlier studies include linear stability estimation, which is valid for small perturbations, but not much work has been done in nonlinear stability analysis for spatial xenon oscillations in particular. In this paper, an approach for carrying out bifurcation analysis of xenon oscillations in large pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) is demonstrated using reduced-order models. The reduced-order model for studying spatial xenon oscillations consists of multipoint kinetic equations coupled with xenon and iodine equations along with explicit fuel and coolant temperature feedback. Both subcritical Hopf bifurcation and supercritical Hopf bifurcation in different parameter planes exist, which leads to unstable limit cycles in the linearly stable region (subcritical Hopf bifurcation) and stable limit cycles in the linearly unstable region (supercritical Hopf bifurcation). The stability map provides a total picture of the stability of the out-of-phase oscillations in a PHWR. Depending on the value of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity and coolant temperature coefficient of reactivity, one can determine the operating power level above which the out-of-phase xenon oscillations start to grow. This model can be used to analyze nonlinear stability characteristics without spatial power control, which is helpful in identification of stable/unstable regimes in different parameter spaces and is likely to aid in reactor design.},

CFD method is a good tool to simulate multidimensional thermal-hydraulics phenomena in the nuclear reactor, which can increase the accuracy of analysis results. However, since there is no neutron kinetics model and pin thermal model in current CFD codes, the application of the CFD method in the area of nuclear reactor safety analyses is still limited. Coupling a CFD code with the neutron kinetics model (PKM) and the pin thermal model (PTM) is a good way to use CFD code to simulate multi-dimensional thermal-hydraulics problems of nuclear reactors. The motivation for this work is to develop a CFD/neutron kinetics coupled code named FLUENT/PK for nuclear reactor safety analyses by coupling the commercial CFD code named FLUENT with the point kinetics model (PKM) and the pin thermal model (PTM). The mathematical models and the coupling method are described and the unprotected transient overpower (UTOP) accident of a liquid metal cooled fast reactor (LMFR) is chosen as an application case. As a general validation, the calculated results are used to compare with that of another multi-physics coupled code named SIMMER-III and good agreements are achieved for various characteristic parameters.},

In addition, structural components like fuel assemblies, vibrate due to strong hydraulic forces. This stochasticity is the cause of the neutron population fluctuating behavior; a phenomenon referred as neutron noise. This paper systematically analyzes the capabilities of the Studsvik's codes to model the fuel assembly vibration and to assess the neutron noise response. To this aim, the CASMO-5 code is utilized for generating cross sections by parametrizing the water-gap thickness of fuel segments. The fuel assembly vibration modelling is approximated by the dynamic modification of the water-gap widths between adjacent assemblies using the transient code SIMULATE-3K. The cross sections dependency on the water-gap width is analyzed and successfully compared against Serpent-2 reference results. Last, the utilized codes capability is verified qualitatively or/and quantitatively through a series of cases, at both lattice and nodal level.},

Deterministic noise solvers have tended to solve for and store this angular flux term in a preprocessing step. This can be a substantial memory burden as the angular flux is a function of space, energy, and angle. This can limit these solvers to smaller problems and can limit the obtainable angular resolution. This paper proposes solving the neutron noise equation and the standard eigenvalue neutron transport equation simultaneously, reducing the memory footprint of a noise solve while making frequency-domain method of characteristics solvers practical. This approach is demonstrated using the random ray method but is applicable to any sweep-based methods. Using the random ray method also has the advantage of exact geometry representation, no ray effects, and cheaper transport sweeps, all of which have been problematic. These advantages are illustrated on several noise problems.},

The algorithm has two important characteristics: low computational complexity, comparable to that of orthogonal matching pursuit techniques when applied to very sparse signals, and reconstruction accuracy of the same order as that of linear programming (LP) optimization methods. The presented analysis shows that in the noiseless setting, the proposed algorithm can exactly reconstruct arbitrary sparse signals provided that the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property with a constant parameter. In the noisy setting and in the case that the signal is not exactly sparse, it can be shown that the mean-squared error of the reconstruction is upper-bounded by constant multiples of the measurement and signal perturbation energies.},

  abstract = {Reactor noise analysis, based upon the monitoring of the deviations of typically the neutron flux from its mean value, has for objectives a) the early detection of anomalies before they have any inadvertent effect on plant safety and availability and b) the determination of dynamical core parameters. Because noise analysis is a non-intrusive technique, it can be used on-line while the reactor is running at nominal full power conditions. One of the challenges of noise diagnostics is nevertheless to be able to recover from very few neutron detector signals the nature and characteristics of the driving perturbation, localize it, and classify the severity of the anomaly. This requires competences in many areas, such as reactor physics and dynamics, reactor modelling, stochastic processes, signal analysis, and measurement techniques. This paper represents an attempt to pay a tribute to Dr. P{\'a}zsit's seminal work on power reactor noise at the occasion of the special session organized in his honor at M\&C 2017. Emphasis will be put on the development of innovative methods that resulted in industrial demonstrations at commercial nuclear power stations. The subjects covered hereafter are: the monitoring of control rod vibrations, the characterization and localization of anomalies, the diagnostics of BWR instabilities and the diagnostics of core barrel vibrations.},

For each situation, the static neutron flux, the different eigenmodes and eigenvalues, the first-order neutron noise, and their adjoint functions are estimated, as well as the effective multiplication factor of the system. The main advantages of the tool, which is entirely MatLab based, lie with the robustness of the implemented numerical algorithms, its high portability between different computer platforms and operative systems, and finally its ease of use since no input deck writing is required. The present version of the tool, which is based on two-group diffusion theory, is mostly suited to investigate thermal systems. The definition of both the static and dynamic core configurations directly from the static macroscopic cross-sections and their fluctuations, respectively, makes the tool particularly well suited for research and education. Some of the many benchmark cases used to validate the tool are briefly reported. The static and dynamic capabilities of the tool are also demonstrated for the following configurations: a vibrating control rod, a perturbation traveling upwards with the core flow, and a high frequency localized perturbation. The tool is freely available on direct request to the author of the present paper.},

For the frequency-domain approach, the scenarios include: a generic "absorber of variable strength", axially-travelling perturbations at the velocity of the flow (due to e.g. fluctuations of the coolant temperature or coolant flow at the inlet of the core), fuel assembly vibrations, control rod vibrations, and core barrel vibrations. For the time-domain approach, the scenarios include: fuel assembly vibrations, inlet coolant temperature fluctuations, inlet coolant flow fluctuations, and their possible combinations.},

This simulator calculates both the direct and the adjoint reactor transfer function between a stationary noise source and its induced neutron noise for any 2-dimensional heterogeneous critical system. The main advantage of this neutron noise simulator is that any realistic core can be modelled, since the simulator is designed to rely on a set of material constants corresponding to the actual reactor operating conditions. The calculations are performed in the 2-group diffusion approximation and in the frequency domain. The spatial discretisation is carried out with respect to the finite difference scheme. The noise source, expressed as an ``absorber of variable strength'' type, is defined directly from the fluctuations of the macroscopic cross-sections and can be spatially distributed over the core or concentrated in a few discrete nodes. If the noise source is a point-source, the simulator actually estimates the 2-dimensional 2-group discretised Green's function of the system. From the calculated Green's function, the neutron noise induced by a ``vibrating absorber'' type of noise source can also be determined. Different benchmark cases show that this neutron noise simulator works satisfactorily.},

This method makes use of the application of a stationary perturbation to the system at a given frequency and extraction of the point-kinetic component of the system response. Even for strongly heterogeneous systems for which an analytical solution does not exist, the point-kinetic component follows, as a function of frequency, a simple analytical form. The comparison between the extracted point-kinetic component and its expected analytical form provides an opportunity to verify and validate neutron transport solvers. The proposed method is tested on two diffusion-based codes, one working in the time domain and the other working in the frequency domain. As long as the applied perturbation has a non-zero reactivity effect, it is demonstrated that the method can be successfully applied to verify and validate time- or frequency-dependent neutron transport solvers. Although the method is demonstrated in the present paper in a diffusion theory framework, higher order neutron transport methods could be verified based on the same principles.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the possibility of localising a noise source of the type ``absorber of variable strength'' (or reactor oscillator) from as few as five neutron detectors evenly distributed throughout the core of a commercial nuclear reactor. The novelty of this investigation lies with the fact that the calculations are performed for a realistic 2-D heterogeneous reactor in the 2-group diffusion approximation, via the prior determination of the corresponding reactor transfer function. It is first demonstrated that the response of such a reactor to a localized perturbation deviates significantly from point-kinetics. The space-dependence of the induced neutron noise thus carries enough information about the location of the noise source, which makes it possible to determine its position from a few detector readings. The identification of the type of noise source is easily performed from the in-phase behaviour of the induced neutron noise. Different unfolding techniques are finally tested. All these techniques rely on the use of the reactor transfer function. One of these techniques is based on the comparison between the actual measured neutron noise and the neutron noise calculated for every possible location of the noise source. This technique is very reliable and almost insensitive to the contamination of the detector signals by background noise, but also extremely CPU consuming. Another technique, based on the piece-wise inversion of the reactor transfer function and requiring little CPU effort, was developed. Although this technique is much less reliable when background noise is present, this technique is useful to indicate a region of the reactor where a noise source is likely to be located.},

  abstract = {Capitalizing on some earlier work, this paper presents a novel Monte Carlo-based approach that allows estimating the neutron noise induced by stationary perturbations of macroscopic cross-sections in the frequency domain. This method relies on the prior computation using Monte Carlo of modified Green's functions associated to the real part of the dynamic macroscopic cross-sections, mimicking equivalent subcritical problems driven by external neutron sources. Once such modified Green's functions are estimated, the neutron noise induced by any type of perturbations can be recovered, by solving a linear algebra problem accounting for the interdependence between the real and imaginary parts of the governing balance equations. The newly derived method was demonstrated on a large homogeneous test system and on a small heterogeneous test system to provide results comparable to a diffusionbased solver specifically developed for neutron noise applications. The new method requires the specification by the user of the real part of the Fourier transform of the macroscopic crosssections. This is accomplished using ACE-formatted cross-section files defined by the user. Beyond this input data preparation, no change to the Monte Carlo source code is necessary. This represents the main advantage of the proposed method as compared to similar efforts requiring extensive modifications to the Monte Carlo source code.},

This paper reports on the development as well as the test and application of the numerical tools employed. The code that was developed yields the space-dependence of the fluctuations of the neutron flux induced by fluctuating properties of the medium in the two-group diffusion approximation and in a two-dimensional representation of heterogeneous systems, for both critical systems and non-critical systems with an external source. Some applications of these tools to power reactor noise analysis are then described, including the unfolding of the parameters of the noise source from the~induced neutron noise, measured at a few discrete locations throughout the core. Other concrete applications concern the study of the space-dependence of the Decay Ratio in Boiling Water Reactors, the noise-based estimation of the Moderator Temperature Coefficient of reactivity in Pressurized Water Reactors, the modeling of the beam- and shell-mode core-barrel vibrations in Pressurized Water Reactors, and the investigation of the validity of the point-kinetic approximation in subcritical systems driven by an external source. In most of these applications, calculations performed using the code are compared with at-power plant measurements. Power reactor noise analysis applications of the above type, i.e. core monitoring without disturbing plant operation, is of particular interest in the framework of the extensive program of power uprates worldwide.},

It is known from earlier work that the noise method systematically underestimates the MTC. In this paper, it is found that the main reason for the underestimation lies with the radial incoherence of the temperature fluctuations. The deviation of the reactor response from point-kinetics is another possible reason, but it was found to play a quite insignificant role. The theory of neutron noise, induced by spatially random perturbations is elaborated and by its help the inaccuracy (bias) of the noise based MTC estimation was quantitatively investigated. It was found that a relatively short correlation length of the temperature fluctuations, which is in agreement with experimental evidence, can explain the observed underestimation of the MTC by the noise method.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the underlying physical mechanisms involved in the monochromatic vibrations of fuel assemblies and their effects on the induced neutron noise throughout the core of nuclear reactors, in the framework of simplified benchmark configurations. Any vibrating fuel pin introduces noise sources at the frequency of vibrations, as well as at higher harmonics, the first one being the most significant of those. Depending on the harmonics considered, the position of the vibrating fuel pin, the size of the core and its macroscopic cross-sections, different noise responses are observed within the reactor core. Through the lens of a decomposition of the neutron noise into its point-kinetics component and its deviation from it, the spectrum of noise responses is explained and related to the spatial distribution of the amplitude and phase of the noise sources at the considered frequencies. At the frequency of vibration, possible out-of-phase behaviour of the induced neutron noise can be partially or totally shadowed by the in-phase point-kinetics component, the only exception being for central vibrations in symmetrical systems. At the frequency of the first higher harmonics, the structure of the induced neutron noise is more involved. Nevertheless, due to the compensation of the individual responses associated to the different components of the noise source at that frequency, point-kinetics has a significant contribution. The results of this work sheds new light on the complex spatial pattern of the neutron noise computed by realistic core simulators in case of vibrations of fuel assemblies.},

This circulation introduces important phenomena in the study of reactor physics, thus requiring changes in the existing physical models applied in conventional reactors with solid fuel. One of the main influences of the fuel flow in the reactor is in the delayed neutron precursors' concentration, which partially decay outside the core, not contributing to the fission chain reaction. In this paper, we investigate the physical models used for this type of reactor, especially the neutron point kinetics, in order to develop an inverse kinetics model, which has practical applications such as core reactivity monitoring. We develop a semi-analytical solution for the proposed model, which is used to solve two transients: a linear variation between power levels, and the determination of criticality regions during a decrease in flow velocity.},

  abstract = {In the present work the problem of the on-line monitoring of the reactivity in a source-free nuclear reactor is considered. The method is based on the classic point kinetic model of reactor physics. A relationship between the instantaneous value of the system stable period and the values of the neutron flux amplitude (or the power), of its derivative and of the integral convolution term determining the instantaneous value of the effective delayed neutron concentration is derived. The reactivity can then be evaluated through the application of the inhour equation, assuming the effective delayed neutron fraction and prompt generation time are known from independent measurements. Since the power related quantities can be assumed to be experimental observables at each instant, the reactivity can be easily reconstructed. The method is tested at first through the interpretation of power histories simulated by the solution of the point kinetic equations; the effect of the time interval between power detections on the accuracy is studied, proving the excellent performance of the procedure. The work includes also a study on the sensitivity of the reactivity forecast to the uncertainty on the values of the effective delayed neutron fraction and prompt generation time. The spatial effects are investigated by applying the method to the interpretation of flux evolution histories generated by a numerical code solving the space--time dependent neutron kinetic equations in the diffusion model. Also in this case the method proves to be quite effective in providing good estimates of the system reactivity, except at very short times after the introduction of a perturbation inducing a spatial transient. At last, the effect of the experimental noise is investigated, proving that the consequences in the accuracy of the reactivity prediction can be mitigated by using an adequate differentiation algorithm.},

  abstract = {Thermal molten salt reactors can be designed in many configurations. This paper investigates the optimal geometry of a one fluid molten salt reactor (OFMSR) in a virtual one-and-half fluid configuration with a fixed fuel salt volume. Two primary configurations were studied, axial blanket (three models) and radial blanket (two models). Neutronic calculations were performed using Monte Carlo N-particle 6.2 (MCNP6.2) and Serpent-2 reactor physics codes with evaluated nuclear data files/B-VII.0 continuous neutron library. The analysis comprises criticality calculation, temperature coefficient of reactivity (TCR), breeding ratio (BR), and kinetic parameters. The results imply a good agreement between MCNP and Serpent calculations. TCR values show a different pattern between axial and radial blanket configuration. While the correlation between TCR and BR is inversely correlated in axial blanket, it is linear in radial blanket configuration. Overall, radial blanket configuration seemed to show better neutronic performance than axial blanket configuration, with comparably strong negative TCR and large BR.},

  abstract = {The neutron noise induced by propagating perturbations in a simple model of a Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) is calculated and analyzed using one/two-group diffusion theory. The novelty, as compared to previous works, is that the noise source includes also the fluctuations of the fission cross sections and the fluid velocity, in addition to the previous case when only the fluctuations of the absorption cross section were accounted for. Another novelty is that the solution is obtained through the matrix Green's function of the flux and precursor equations, these two being kept separate. Inclusion of each of these two new noise sources leads to a structure of the noise source, and hence also that of the neutron noise, which is conceptually different from the case when only the fluctuations of the absorption cross sections are treated, with some surprising features. The use of the matrix Green's function is advantageous to understand the new features, and it helps to point out some new aspects of the neutron noise even in traditional systems, which have not been noticed before. The results contribute to the understanding and interpretation of the neutron noise in MSRs.},

The models and algorithms used in the coupled version of CORE SIM, as well as the demonstration of the tool were already presented in two companion reports [1, 2]. The novelty of the tool resides in its versatility, since many different systems can be investigated and different kinds of calculations can be performed. More precisely, both critical systems and subcritical systems with an external neutron source can be studied, static and dynamic cases in the frequency domain (i.e. for stationary fluctuations) can be considered. For each situation, the three dimensional distributions of static neutron fluxes, all thermo-hydraulic parameters, their respective first-order noise are estimated, as well as the effective multiplication factor of the system. The main advantages of the tool, which is entirely MATLAB based, lie with the robustness of the implemented numerical algorithms, its high portability between different computer platforms and operative systems, and finally its ease of use since no input deck writing is required. The present version of the tool, which is based on two-group diffusion theory, is mostly suited to investigate thermal systems, both Pressurized and BoilingWater Reactors (PWR and BWR, respectively).

The methodology is demonstrated by a numerical example, comparing a deterministic nodal diffusion calculation using Serpent-generated cross sections to a reference full-core Monte Carlo simulation. It is concluded that the new methodology improves the results of the deterministic calculation, and paves the way for Monte Carlo based group constant generation.},

The objectives are to introduce a generalized bias factor method to avoid full mock-up experiment for the first commercial HTGR and to introduce reactor noise analysis to High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) experiment to observe sub-criticality. To achieve the objectives, the reactor core of graphite-moderation system named B7/4''G2/8''p8EUNU+3/8''p38EU(1) was newly composed in the B-rack of Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA). The core is composed of the fuel assembly, driver fuel assembly, graphite reflector, and polyethylene reflector. The fuel assembly is composed of enriched uranium plate, natural uranium plate and graphite plates to realize the average fuel enrichment of HTTR and it's spectrum. However, driver fuel assembly is necessary to achieve the criticality with the small-sized core. The core plays a role of the reference core of the bias factor method, and the reactor noise was measured to develop the noise analysis scheme. In this study, the overview of the criticality experiments is reported. The reactor configuration with graphite moderation system is rare case in the KUCA experiments, and this experiment is expected to contribute not only for an HTGR development but also for other types of a reactor in the graphite moderation system such as a molten salt reactor development.},

The periodic movement is built by properly linking the geometries corresponding to the temporal positions. The calculation is entirely performed in the real time domain, without resorting to the traditional frequency approach. A specifically defined dynamic eigenvalue is used to renormalize in average the reactivity over a period. The algorithm is accelerated by the DPN synthetic method. For each cell of the domain, the time values of fission rates are analysed to determine the noise extent. Moreover we propose a systematic approach to the definition of the macroscopic cross sections to be used in dynamical calculations starting from library data.

One method for determining these parameters such as the neutron decay constant {$A$} is through the study of zero-power reactor noise. Theoretical zero-power noise models incorporating spatial variations of kinetic parameter estimators have been developed in the past. However, these models have not been extensively compared to scientific computing tools. This paper aims, first and foremost, to provide a comprehensive review of the methods and theoretical models. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulation is used to numerically validate the counting techniques by comparing their estimations with theoretically calculated values. This process is applied to time correlation estimators such as Rossi-{$A$}, statistical moments estimators like Feynman-{$A$}, and spectral estimators such as Cohn-{$A$}. The paper ultimately presents compelling findings regarding the behavior and characteristics of estimators in a pointwise geometry and offers initial insights into spatial phenomena. Notably, it highlights that the spatial Diven factor is often overlooked in modeling zero-power noise.},

The RMC results agree within about 1\% with results of the SUHAM and nTRACER codes for the TD2-1, TD44 and TD1-3 cases. The denoising method based on polynomial fittings used here improves the results for these cases.},

These developments have stimulated great interest in on-line monitoring (OLM) technologies and new diagnostic and prognostic methods to anticipate, identify, and resolve equipment and process problems and ensure plant safety, efficiency, and immunity to accidents. This paper provides examples of these technologies with particular emphasis on eight key OLM applications: detecting sensing-line blockages, testing the response time of pressure transmitters, monitoring the calibration of pressure transmitters on-line, cross-calibrating temperature sensors in situ, assessing equipment condition, performing predictive maintenance of reactor internals, monitoring fluid flow, and extending the life of neutron detectors. These applications are discussed in the following sections. Emphasis is placed on the principles of a core OLM method -- noise analysis -- and the technical requirements for an integrated OLM system are summarized.},

For a selected combination of those methods and tools, several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess their robustness and trustworthiness. The neutron flux oscillations were simulated using the tool CORE SIM+. It calculates the three-dimensional field of the neutron flux oscillations, which can be used to determine the response of neutron detectors at given locations. For the sensitivity analysis, the neutron flux oscillations were assumed to be caused by the vibration of one fuel element. It was investigated how selected input parameters like the core loading pattern, the burn up of the fuel elements, the neutronic core data, the geometry details of the vibrating fuel element, the chosen detectors, and other noise source parameters like the amplitude of the fuel element vibrations, affect the simulated neutron flux oscillations. A three dimensional fully convolutional neural network had been developed and trained during the CORTEX project to determine the cause and location of perturbations causing given measurements of in-core detectors in pressurized water reactors. The robustness of this network was tested by applying it to the simulated detector readings created during the sensitivity analysis.},

The spatial discretization of the neutron noise equations is based on the Box-Scheme Finite Difference Method (BSFDM) for rectangular-z, triangular-z and hexagonal-z geometries. Using the derived equations, a 3-D 2-group neutron noise simulator is developed, by which the discrete form of both the forward and adjoint reactor dynamic transfer functions (in the frequency domain) can be calculated. In addition, both types of noise sources, namely point-like and traveling perturbations, can be modeled by the developed neutron noise simulator. The results and benchmarking are then reported for the case study of a VVER-type pressurized water reactor core. Considering the boric acid fluctuations as traveling perturbations of the macroscopic thermal absorption cross sections, the induced neutron noise is calculated throughout the reactor core. Space- and frequency-dependence of the propagation noise are also investigated in this work.},

The strength and frequency of noise source(s) are also identified with high accuracy using the developed method. A sensitivity analysis of the reconstructed noise source to some ANN parameters like the number of hidden layers, neurons in each hidden layer and the applied transfer functions is performed.

To this end, the computational code for reconstruction of neutron noise source is developed based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Decision Tree (DT), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Neutron noise source reconstruction process using the developed computational code consists of three stages of training, testing and validation. The information of neutron noise sources and induced neutron noise distributions are used as output and input data of training stage, respectively. As input data, both the real and imaginary parts of numerical value of the neutron noise in the detector are used. In the present study, the neutron noise source of absorber of variable strength type is only considered. The neutron noise distributions in the detectors due to 2000 randomly generated neutron noise sources are calculated using the developed computational code based on Galerkin Finite Element Method (GFEM). As output data, the strength, frequency of occurrence and location (X and Y coordinates) of the considered neutron noise sources are used. The VVER-1000 reactor core is considered as the benchmarking problem for validation of performed simulation using developed computational code. All specifications of neutron noise source including strength, frequency and location of the neutron noise source are reconstructed with high accuracy. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of results to the number of active detectors in the reactor core is performed.

For the experiments, a high-precision linear motor axis is used to insert an oscillating perturbation acting at frequencies smaller than the lower bound of the plateau region of the ZPTF. For higher frequencies, a rotating absorber is used. This device emulates an absorber of variable strength. The reactor response is detected with a He-3 counter.

In this paper we illustrate the validation activities concerning the comparison of the simulation results obtained by several noise simulation codes with respect to experimental data produced at the zero-power reactors AKR-2 (operated at TUD, Germany) and CROCUS (operated at EPFL, Switzerland). Both research reactors are modeled in the time and frequency domains, using transport or diffusion theory. Overall, the noise simulators managed to capture the main features of the neutron noise behavior observed in the experimental campaigns carried out in CROCUS and AKR-2, even though computational biases exist close to the region where the noise-inducing mechanical vibration was located (the so-called "noise source"). In some of the experiments, it was possible to observe the spatial variation of the relative neutron noise, even relatively far from the noise source. This was achieved through reduced uncertainties using long measurements, the installation of numerous, robust and efficient detectors at a variety of positions in the near vicinity or inside the core, as well as new post-processing methods.},

  abstract = {A nuclear technology that has been studied in recent years is related to water-cooled Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). For the development of methods for core monitoring and diagnostics, the analysis of reactor neutron noise has been shown to be effective in large Light Water Reactors and its extension to SMRs may be considered. To localize and identify anomalies in the core via reactor neutron noise, it is essential that the deviation from a point-kinetics behavior is strong enough to be seen at least in the readings of some of the in- and ex-core neutron detectors. The point-kinetics response to perturbations is known to be more dominant in smaller cores, so a relevant question to assess is under which conditions reactor neutron noise-based techniques may be applicable to SMR cores. In this paper, a Pressurized Water Reactor core is used to derive a system whose size is close to the size of a possible water-cooled SMR core. Then, simulations are performed to estimate the reactor neutron noise induced by prescribed vibrations of single fuel assemblies, which is one of the most important perturbations to be monitored, at different locations in the two systems. These simulations show that the so-called spatial component of the reactor neutron noise in the small core tends to be weaker, but the system response may also depend on the different types of fuel assemblies and their arrangement in the core.},

The reactor transfer function is a frequency domain analogy of this temporal description. It can be measured experimentally through transfer function analysis via noise analysis or kinetic modulation, for the study of reactor stability and kinetic parameters. This paper summarizes the experimental measurements of reactor transfer function through kinetic modulation. Extensive work have been conducted experimentally, starting from the beginning of reactor physics research. An overview is given regarding various experimental designs and conducted analyses. The concepts of the modulation system are also discussed.

However, the inverse problem of reconstructing optical parameters from scattered light measurements is highly nonlinear due to the nonlinear coupling between the optical coefscients and the photon ƀux in the diffusion equation. Even though nonlinear iterative methods have been commonly used, such iterative processes are computationally expensive especially for the three dimensional imaging scenario with massive number of detector elements. The main contribution of this paper is a novel non-iterative and exact inversion algorithm when the optical inhomogeneities are sparsely distributed. We show that the problem can be converted into simultaneous sparse representation problem with multiple measurement vectors from compressed sensing framework. The exact reconstruction formula is obtained using simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (S-OMP) and a simple two step approach without ever calculating the diffusion equation. Simulation results also consrm our theory.},

In addition, unlike in the previous paper where in the quantitative work data from a thermal LWR were used, here material data of a conceptual MSR with a thermal spectrum and thorium fuel are used, along with data from both fast and thermal LWRs. Among other things, the relative weight and the range of the local component is investigated. It is found that the strong neutronic coupling in an MSR, which was pointed out in the preceding paper, diminishes the role of the local component as compared to light water reactors. Some further new features of the noise in MSR, not directly related to the two-group approach, are also found.},

In the first step, the calculations were performed for the steady state and results of ACNEM (Average Current Nodal Expansion Method) and HACNEM (High order Average Current Nodal Expansion Method) were examined and compared. To solve the problem, the power iteration algorithm has been used to calculate the distribution of neutron flux and neutron multiplication factor by considering the coarse-mesh (each fuel assembly one node). To validate the steady state calculations, the results were compared with the western nuclear reactor BIBLIS-2D (reference model). In the next step, dynamic calculations were performed in the frequency domain. For this purpose, after discretizing the neutron noise equations by the high-order average current nodal expansion method (NEM), a neutron noise source of absorber with variable strength was simulated. The results were verified by performing simulation at zero frequency and adjoint calculations. Then, the distribution of neutron noise for Inadvertent Loading and Operation of a Fuel Assembly in an Improper Position (ILOFAIP) is obtained. The numerical results showed that the use of HACNEM compared with ACNEM, without reducing the size of the meshes in neutron noise simulation, presented more accurate.},

Specifically the CORE SIM+ modelling framework is employed, which generates these data in the frequency domain. We train using these vast quantities of simulated data state-of-the-art machine and deep learning models which are used to successfully perform semantic segmentation, classification and localisation of multiple simultaneously occurring in-core perturbations. Actual plant data are then considered, provided by two different reactors, including no labels about perturbation existence. A domain adaptation methodology is subsequently developed to extend the simulated setting to real plant measurements, which uses self-supervised, or unsupervised learning, to align the simulated data with the actual plant data and detect perturbations, whilst classifying their type and estimating their location. Experimental studies illustrate the successful performance of the developed approach and extensions are described that indicate a great potential for further research.},

These methods have been applied in several core simulators where homogenization was performed at the level of the pin cell. One of the principal problems has been to recover the error introduced by pin-cell homogenization. Two basic approaches to treat pin-cell homogenization error have been proposed: Superhomogenization (SPH) factors and Pin-Cell Discontinuity Factors (PDF). These methods are based on well established Equivalence Theory and Generalized Equivalence Theory to generate appropriate group constants. These methods are able to treat all sources of error together, allowing even few-group diffusion with one mesh per cell to reproduce the reference solution.{\textasciicircum}},

  abstract = {The present article presents the mechanical characterization of the fuel rods oscillator developed for the purposes of the COLIBRI experimental program in CROCUS. COLIBRI aims at investigating the radiation noise related to fuel vibrations. The main motivation is the increased amplitudes in the neutron noise distributions recorded in ex- and in-core detectors that have been observed in recent years in Siemens pre-Konvoi type of pressurized water reactors. Several potential explanations have been put forward, but no definitive conclusions could yet be drawn. Among others, changes in fuel assembly or pin vibration patterns, due to recent modifications of assembly structural designs, were pointed out as a possible cause. Computational dynamic tools are currently developed within the Horizon 2020 European project CORTEX, to help with understanding the additional noise amplitude. The COLIBRI program is used for their validation. An in-core device was designed, tested, and licensed between 2015 and 2019 for fuel rods oscillation in CROCUS, in successive steps from out-of-pile tests with dummy fuel rods to critical in-core tests. The characterization of its mechanical behavior is presented, in air and in water, and as a function of the load, for safety and experimental purposes. The device allows simultaneously oscillating up to 18 fuel rods. The maximum oscillation amplitude is 5 mm, while the maximum allowed frequency is 2 Hz, i.e. in the frequency range in which the induced neutron flux fluctuations are most pronounced in nuclear power plants.},

The applicability of diffusion theory for different types and locations of the perturbation, as well as different frequencies, is assessed. Material data, i.e. nuclear cross-sections and kinetic parameters, representative of a Light Water Reactor (LWR) and of a Heavy Water Reactor (HWR), respectively, are used in this work. It is demonstrated that for practical situations in LWRs and HWRs, there is no significant advantage to use P1 theory since diffusion theory gives acceptable results. The largest deviations between the two formalisms are observed in regions of large gradients of the static neutron flux, such as close to the reflector interface and close to the perturbation. Such observations are in agreement with theoretical expectations. This study also indicates that neglecting the effect of cross-section perturbation on the diffusion coefficient gives a rather small impact on the solution. This allows drastically simplifying the determination of the neutron noise. When using numerical techniques for such a determination the memory requirements and computational effort can be significantly reduced.},

The numerical solution is also benchmarked to an off-centered source where the analytical solution is determined using the power reactor approximation, extended to two energy groups. The results of the benchmarks are that the numerical calculations using ANM accurately match the analytical solutions.},

The origin of these effects within the derivation of the Sn discrete ordinates equations is shown, and the effects are related to the non-equivalence of the general geometry discrete ordinates equations and the corresponding spherical harmonics equations. Procedures are given for the definition of two-dimensional discrete ordinates equations that are equivalent to the spherical harmonics equations. Elimination of ray effects from the two-dimensional S2 equations by reduction to the diffusion theory equations is verified in a numerical example. Recipes for the elimination of ray effects are analyzed in the analytic solution of the infinite medium, isotropic line-source problem in the rectangular geometry, S2 approximation. Optimum magnitudes for corrective source terms are indicated by the analysis. It is concluded that ray effects may be eliminated by modification of the discrete ordinates formulation, but that the extra computational effort may be more expensive than the alternative of increasing the order of angular quadrature and that the presence of discretization effects may serve as an indicator of the adequacy of the angular quadrature used.},

In many multiscale bases (e.g. wavelets), signals of interest (e.g. piecewisesmooth signals) not only have few significant coefficients, but also those significant coefficients are well-organized in trees. We propose to exploit this sparse tree representation as additional prior information for linear inverse problems with limited numbers of measurements. In particular, our proposed algorithm named Tree-based Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (TOMP) is shown to provide significant better reconstruction compared to methods that only use sparse representation assumption.},

This article is devoted to the description of this approach with two different sets of equations depending on the aimed precision. We tested the TFM approach in several instances. In the calculation of the kinetic parameters such as beff and Keff on the Flattop and Jezebel experiments, the results obtained are compatible with adjoint weighted calculations performed with the Monte Carlo neutron transport code SERPENT. Likewise, our calculated value of the aRossi observable is also compatible with the experimental measurement. Finally a time--space prompt neutron propagation induced by a neutron pulse on Flattop has been calculated using the TFM approach and compared to a reference time dependent SERPENT calculation. Again, the results obtained demonstrate the good characterization of the time--space system response by the TFM approach.},

  abstract = {Compressed sensing of simultaneously sparse and low-rank matrices enables recovery of sparse signals from a few linear measurements of their bilinear form. One important question is how many measurements are needed for a stable reconstruction in the presence of measurement noise. Unlike conventional compressed sensing for sparse vectors, where convex relaxation via the 1-norm achieves near-optimal performance, for compressed sensing of sparse low-rank matrices, it has been shown recently that convex programmings using the nuclear norm and the mixed norm are highly suboptimal even in the noise-free scenario. We propose an alternating minimization algorithm called sparse power factorization (SPF) for compressed sensing of sparse rank-one matrices. For a class of signals whose sparse representation coefficients are fast-decaying, SPF achieves stable recovery of the rank-one matrix formed by their outer product and requires number of measurements within a logarithmic factor of the information-theoretic fundamental limit. For the recovery of general sparse low-rank matrices, we propose subspace-concatenated SPF (SCSPF), which has analogous near-optimal performance guarantees to SPF in the rank-one case. Numerical results show that SPF and SCSPF empirically outperform convex programmings using the best known combinations of mixed norm and nuclear norm.},

  abstract = {The controllability of linearized equations of the equivalent normalized version of the reactor point kinetics equations with six delayed neutron groups and without neutron source at an equilibrium power is analyzed. There exists inconsistency between the results from two kinds of approaches. The equations analyzed are controllable according to the controllability evaluation by analytical derivation while they are uncontrollable by numerical calculation. The reason of this inconsistency is that the large difference between the time effect of prompt neutrons and that of delayed neutrons in reactors reduces the controllability matrix to become a rank-deficient matrix under the conditions of using finite-precision arithmetic. In order to improve the analysis approach and address the divergence in outcomes, a novel definition of degree of controllability is proposed by means of applying matrix norm and singular value decomposition (SVD). This definition resolves the inconsistent conclusions, i.e., the equations analyzed are controllable but their degree of controllability is very low. The calculation of the degree of controllability shows that in the multiple representations of point reactor kinetics, the representations of fewgroup models are more propitious to analyze and design the control system of nuclear reactor than the representation of six-group model.},

The results are then benchmarked against the well-known CITATION computer code. The dynamic calculations are performed in the frequency domain which leads to discarding of the time discretisation. Then, the developed 2-D 2-group neutron noise simulator calculates both the discretised forward and the adjoint reactor transfer function between a point source and its induced neutron noise, by assuming the neutron noise source as an ``absorber of variable strength'' type. The neutron noise induced by a ``vibrating absorber'' type of noise source may also be modeled using the calculated transfer function.

The boxscheme finite difference method is first developed for hexagonal geometries, to be used for spatial discretisation of both 2-D 2-group static and noise diffusion equations.

The developed 2-D 2group neutron noise simulator calculates both the discretised forward and the adjoint reactor transfer function between a point-like source and its induced neutron noise, by assuming the noise source as an absorber of variable strength type. Benchmarking of the mentioned neutron noise simulator revealed that it works satisfactorily. Finally, by using the inversion method of reconstruction, the location and values of a noise source of the type absorber of variable strength (or reactor oscillator) in VVER-1000 reactor cores are determined. Accuracy of this method is highly acceptable.},

In addition, both types of noise sources, namely point-like and traveling perturbations, can be modeled by TRIDYN-3. The results are then benchmarked in different cases.

This surveillance is focused mainly on the pendular motion of the core barrel, which is known as the beam mode. The monitoring of the beam mode has suggested that its amplitude increases along the cycle and decreases after refuelling. In the last 5 years several measurements have been taken in order to understand this behaviour. Besides, a non-linear fitting procedure has been implemented in order to better distinguish the different components of vibration. By using this fitting procedure, two modes of vibration have been identified in the frequency range of the beam mode. Several results coming from the trend analysis performed during these years indicate that one of the modes is due to the core barrel motion itself and the other is due to the individual flow induced vibrations of the fuel elements. In this work, the latest results of this monitoring are presented.},

In this paper, we derive sparse recovery guarantees with OMP, when the CS matrix has unequal column norms. Finally, we show that CS matrices whose column norms are comparable achieve tight guarantees for the successful recovery of the support of a sparse signal and a low mean squared error in the estimate.},

This paper describes the first two steady state exercises, their objectives and the international participation in terms of organization, country and computer code utilized. This description is followed by a comparison and analysis of the participants' results submitted for these two exercises. The comparison of results from different codes allows for an assessment of the sensitivity of a result to the method employed and can thus help to focus the development efforts on the most critical areas. The two first exercises also allow for removing of user-related modeling errors and prepare core neutronics and thermal-hydraulics models of the different codes for the rest of the exercises in the benchmark.},

By means of noise analysis techniques in the time domain (autoregressive models) and the Dynamic Data System methodology, the two time constants of the system can be found. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed in order to choose the proper sampling time to obtain both constants. The two poles are found and they permit an advance in situ surveillance of the sensor response time and the sensor dynamics performance. One of the poles is related to the inner dynamics whereas the other one is linked to the process and the inner dynamics.

  abstract = {The Division of Subatomic Physics and Plasma Physics (formerly Division of Nuclear Engineering) in Chalmers, G{\"o}teborg, and the Ringhals Nuclear Plant have investigated the core barrel vibrations in the Ringhals PWRs over the last 20 years. Based on the different symmetry properties of the vibration modes, a mode separation technique was developed to enhance the contributions from the different modes. Recent observations of wear at both the lower and upper core-barrel-support structures in the Ringhals PWRs indicated that vibration modes of the core barrel other than pendular (beam mode) and shell mode are likely to occur. A beam mode type movement alone is not able to explain such a wear, and therefore, it is fair to assume that the vibration mode in question is a small amplitude periodic tilting movement of the core barrel around a horizontal, diagonal pivot at the half height of the core. In this work, ex-core data taken in the Ringhals-4 PWR were analyzed in order to find evi- dence of such a tilting movement. First, cross spectra between various ex-core detectors were calculated and analyzed to locate the frequency range of the new vibrational mode. Then, a model based on symmetry considerations was derived in order to extract the sought mode from the spectra. The measurements were evaluated by the new mode enhancement technique. The results show that it is possible to enhance such a mode and find it in the spectra by properly combining the signals in the time domain.},

  abstract = {The paper presents CORE SIM+, a tool developed for diffusion-based neutron noise simulations. The simulator is based on the 3-dimensional, two-energy group neutron diffusion equation in the frequency domain. The tool includes the necessary solvers to calculate the criticality problems associated with the system and then the response to a variety of perturbations such as absorbers of variable strength, perturbations travelling with the coolant flow and vibrations of core components. Numerical methods suitable for different types of problems have been implemented. A capability that allows to apply nonuniform computational meshes is available so that the discretization of the domain can be optimized with respect to the characteristics of the neutron noise sources. The simulator can generate neutron noise databases for nuclear power reactors via the Green's function method in a fully automated manner. These databases can be useful when studying the neutron noise response in a reactor and when training machine learning algorithms for core monitoring and diagnostics. As part of the verification process, the CORE SIM+ response of a realistic reactor model to a given perturbation at various frequencies is used to estimate the corresponding point-kinetic component, compared to an exact analytical expression. In addition, the Green's function generator is used to calculate the response of a system to a fuel cell vibration. The solution is then compared to the one of the direct solver of CORE SIM+. As part of the validation work, a neutron noise experiment with vibrations of fuel rods is simulated, showing a reasonable agreement with the measurements. A representative neutron noise database generated for a generic pressurized water reactor is described. From the database the simulations of fuel assembly and core barrel vibrations are chosen as illustrative examples for demonstrating the capabilities of the tool.},

Reactor neutron noise is related to fluctuations of the neutron flux induced by stationary perturbations of the properties of the system. Its monitoring and analysis can provide useful insights in the reactor operations. The model used in the work relies on the neutron diffusion approximation and requires the solution of both the criticality (eigenvalue) and neutron noise equations. A highresolution spatial discretization of the equations is important for an accurate evaluation of the neutron noise because of the strong gradients that may arise from the perturbations. Considering the size of a nuclear reactor, the application of a fine mesh generates large systems of equations which can be challenging to solve. Then, numerical methods that can provide efficient solutions for these kinds of problems using a reasonable computational effort, are investigated. In particular the power method accelerated with the Chebychev or JFNK-based techniques for the eigenvalue problem, and GMRES with the Symmetric Gauss-Seidel, ILU, SPAI preconditioners for the solution of linear systems, are evaluated with the computation of neutron noise in the case of localized perturbations in 1-D and 2-D simplified reactor cores and in a 3D realistic reactor core.},

The reference MSR is a 600MW (thermal), fast neutron spectrum reactor using a mixture of NaCl--CaCl2--UCl3--PuCl3 as fuel. An MSR core was designed with the composition of the fuel and the core geometry based on several references. The reactor physical characteristics were calculated for the core using the ERANOS code system. The results show that the reactor can be critical with a compact size and has high passive safety with negative temperature feedback coefficients. A control rod bundle made of stainless steel without the need for strong neutron absorbers was designed. It is expected that reactor physics experiments are needed for MSR development. To design reactor physics experiments for the MSR, the current research target is to use the existing critical assembly in Japan, KUCA, to its maximum potential. Several configurations are proposed and the representativity factor of the experiments to the MSR was evaluated. The results show that the designed configurations have a relatively low representativity. Therefore, a configuration based on the ZPPR using plutonium fuel and with a large size was designed. The results demonstrate that the experimental configuration is very similar to the MSR. This suggests that to design reactor physics experiments for MSR, a critical facility like the ZPPR should be built in the future.},

  author = {Novak, April},
  year = {2020},
  address = {Berkeley, California},
  abstract = {Pebble bed reactors (PBRs) are expected to display excellent heat removal characteristics due to graphite's capability for storing and transferring heat, the high failure temperatures of particle fuel, and the low power densities involved. However, a major challenge associated with the modeling of PBRs is the complex fuel-coolant structure in the core. Thermalhydraulic (T/H) modeling of PBRs requires consideration of thermal and  ow e{\enspace}ects over {\enspace}ve orders in spatial magnitude{\textbar}from 109 fuel particles, each about 1 mm in size, to 5{\enspace}105 pebbles, each about 5 cm in size, within a 10 m-size reactor core in the larger context of a power generating system. This research develops and applies multiscale methods to the thermal analysis of PBRs. By decomposing the complex PBR geometry into coupled models for three characteristic length scales{\textbar}the particle, pebble, and core{\textbar}e{\enspace}cient predictions of core T/H relevant to reactor design are achieved. These multiscale models are implemented in a new {\enspace}nite element software application built on the open source Multiphysics Object-Oriented Software Environment (MOOSE). By leveraging state-of-the-art numerical methods, solvers, and meshing tools, this dissertation enables rapid design and analysis for scoping studies, fast-turnaround design, and multiphysics cou2 pling to a comprehensive reactor analysis framework. Application of multiscale analysis to a wide variety of  ows demonstrates the software tool's capabilities as a general  ow solver and the applicability of these models to both porous and open  ows. Veri{\enspace}cation for open  ows shows that the multiscale model reduces to the Navier-Stokes equations in regions such as reactor plena, where prediction of mixing and the ensuing thermal stresses are essential to the design of reactor internals. Application to the SANA experiments, a gas-cooled scaled PBR facility, demonstrates that the multiscale model predicts the passive conduction cool-down heat removal process with an average solid temperature error of 22.6{\enspace}C. Statistical analysis as a function of position within the bed and other experimental characteristics highlights limitations of model closures and simpli{\enspace}cations that are useful in guiding further macroscale analysis of gas-cooled PBRs. Supported by the veri{\enspace}cation and validation for open  ows and gas systems, full-core steadystate T/H analysis is performed for the Mark-1 Pebble Bed Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High- Temperature Reactor (PB-FHR). The unconventional re ector block design, uniquely thin fuel-matrix annulus, and non-uniform  ow boundary conditions (BCs) highlight the new capabilities enabled by this research for PBR industrial analysis. Two multiscale fuel models are compared against full-resolved PB-FHR fuel pebbles for a wide range in thermal conditions. While a homogeneous layer model is characterized by errors in excess of 200{\enspace}C, a linear superposition method is shown to predict average and maximum temperatures to within 10{\enspace}C. Early models of PBRs have struggled to accurately characterize the core bypass fraction, with signi{\enspace}cant implications on fuel temperature predictions. A porous media model is constructed of the re ectors corresponding to the maximum-bypass end-of-life condition with friction factor correlations generated using COMSOL Multiphysics. A tensor representation of the friction factor shows that the momentum loss is signi{\enspace}cantly higher in the radial than the axial direction. These drag models are combined with the multiscale fuel veri{\enspace}cation for full-core analysis of the PB-FHR. A parametric study varying the re ector block gap distribution and the in ow port design demonstrates that the in ow BC has a signi{\enspace}cant e{\enspace}ect on the core bypass fraction and that the bypass fraction is a strong function of the re ector block gap distribution. The maximum bypass fraction is predicted to be within the range of 11.9\%\{14.0\% depending on the in ow BC and gap distribution. For a bottomheavy center re ector inlet, fuel and re ector temperature predictions are provided. The primary e{\enspace}ect of the core bypass is to uniformly raise core temperatures; for all re ector 3 gap distributions, the maximum kernel temperature is approximately 93{\enspace}C higher than the maximum  uid temperature, which remains far below the fuel failure limit. This work demonstrates the utility of multiscale methods to thermal analysis of PBRs. In conjunction with the larger scienti{\enspace}c community, this research enables fast-turnaround design and analysis of all single-phase PBRs to facilitate the contribution of advanced nuclear reactors to a clean energy future.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with a method to evaluate signal transmission paths (STP) in dynamic systems. The STP analysis in the present study intends to clarify through fluctuation analysis the cause-effect relationship between measured signals in both qualitative and quantitative manner. In order to facilitate the analysis, we define a new function called signal power contribution ratio which represents relative contributions to the output from the input. The analysis is executed through comparative evaluation of the coherence, noise power contribution and signal power contribution functions calculated based upon autoregressive modeling. It is shown that comparison of these three functions provides information useful to evaluate the signal transmission paths. The present method has been applied to noise signals collected a t Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR)-IT. The result of the analysis suggested its effectiveness for investigation of at-power reactor noise, especially in identifying possible noise sources and their propagation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a sensitive and relatively low cost imaging modality that reconstructs optical properties of a highly scattering medium. However, due to the diffusive nature of light propagation, the problem is severely ill-conditioned and highly nonlinear. Even though nonlinear iterative methods have been commonly used, they are computationally expensive especially for three dimensional imaging geometry. Recently, compressed sensing theory has provided a systematic understanding of high resolution reconstruction of sparse objects in many imaging problems; hence, the goal of this paper is to extend the theory to the diffuse optical tomography problem. The main contributions of this paper are to formulate the imaging problem as a joint sparse recovery problem in a compressive sensing framework and to propose a novel noniterative and exact inversion algorithm that achieves the optimality as the rank of measurement increases to the unknown sparsity level. The algorithm is based on the recently discovered generalized MUSIC criterion, which exploits the advantages of both compressive sensing and array signal processing. A theoretical criterion for optimizing the imaging geometry is provided, and simulation results confirm that the new algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms and reliably reconstructs the optical inhomogeneities when we assume that the optical background is known to a reasonable accuracy.},

The monitoring system is based on the analysis of the ``noise'' or fluctuations of a signal from a sensor or measurement device. An efficient prime factor algorithm to compute the fast Fourier transform allows the continuous, real-time comparison of the normalized power spectrum density function of the signal against previously stored reference patterns in a continuously evolving matrix. The monitoring system has been successfully tested offline. Four examples of the application of the monitoring system to the detection and diagnostic of faulty equipment behavior are presented in this work: the detection of two different events of partial blockage at the jet pump inlet nozzle, miss-calibration of a recirculation mass flow sensor, and detection of a faulty data acquisition card. The events occurred at the two BWR Units of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant. The monitoring system and its possible coupling to the data and processing information system of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant are described. The signal processing methodology is presented along with the introduction of the application of the evolutionary matrix concept for determining the base signature of reactor equipment or component and the detection of off normal operation conditions.},

  abstract = {The present discussion is an extension of a new model recently developed for neutron point kinetics, where the reactivity is decomposed in terms of short and long timescales. The short timescale corresponds to the operational control of the reactor, while the long timescale corresponds to the effects of the chemical composition variation in the nuclear fuel as a consequence of fission and neutron capture processes. This work considers not only the effects of the main neutron poisons but contains also a first analysis of the effects of some transuranium. The proposed model consists of a system of non-linear equations, which is solved by the use of the Adomian decomposition method. This method expands the solution into an infinite series, whose contributions are obtained by the solution of a recursive equation system where the non-linear terms are treated as source terms. These are calculated by so-called Adomian polynomials and are constructed from the solutions obtained in previous recursion steps. An approach is proposed, that diagonalizes the linear matrix in order to circumvent the existing stiffness problem, which is also responsible for instabilities in the computational algorithm. Two case studies are presented, analysing the non-linear behaviour of nuclear reactor kinetics with constant reactivity using input parameters for which the algorithm was stable. Further, a standard point kinetics case with periodic reactivity is performed in order to compare the present model to a standard point kinetics simulation from the literature.},

  abstract = {Neutron fluctuations in a constant multiplying medium (zero power noise), and those in a fluctuating medium (power reactor noise) have been traditionally considered as two separate disciplines, that exist in two opposing limiting areas of operation (low and high power, respectively). They have also been treated by different mathematical methods, i.e. master equations and Langevin equation, respectively. In this paper we develop a theory of neutron fluctuations in a medium randomly varying in time, based on a forward type master equation approach. This method accounts for both the zero power and the power reactor noise simultaneously. Factorial moments and related quantities (variance, power spectrum etc.) of the number of the neutrons are calculated in subcritical systems with a stationary external source. It is shown that the pure zero power and power reactor noise results can be reconstructed in the cases of vanishing system fluctuations and high power, respectively, the latter being a non-trivial result. Further, it is shown that the effect of system fluctuations on the zero power noise is retained even in the limit of vanishing neutron number (reactor power). The results have thus even practical significance for low-power systems with fluctuating properties. The results also have a bearing on other types of branching processes, such as evolution of biological systems, germ colonies, epidemics etc., which take place in a time-varying environment.},

We first utilize the vast quantities of synthetic data generated from the extended SIMULATE-3K codes, simulating a Swiss 3-loop pre-KONVOI reactor to train our networks under a variety of differing perturbation settings. Additionally, we extend these approaches to operate in the setting of unsupervised real plant measurements, where information about the true perturbation characteristics is unknown. As such, we show the applicability of a self-supervised domain adaptation approach to correctly align the representations learned by the neural network between both the synthetic and real detector readings to more concretely classify and localize perturbation. We validate our approaches under a number of experimental analyses showing successful performance in both simulated and synthetic domains.},

From 2005, multiple measurements were taken during each fuel cycle, and these revealed a periodic behavior of the 8-Hz peak of the beam-mode motion: the amplitude increases within the cycle and returns to a lower value at the beginning of the next cycle. The work reported in this paper aims to clarify the physical reason for this behavior. A combination of a mode separation method in the time domain and a nonlinear curve-fitting procedure of the frequency spectra revealed that two types of vibration phenomena contribute to the beam-mode peak. The lower frequency peak around 7 Hz in the ex-core detector APSDs corresponds to the CBM, whose amplitude does not change during the cycle. The higher frequency peak around 8 Hz arises from the individual vibrations of the fuel assemblies, and its amplitude increases monotonically during the cycle. This paper gives an account of the work that has been made to verify the above hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The problem of linearizing the neutron noise induced by a vibrating absorber is discussed fully. First it is shown by a formal proof why the traditional linearization method of noise theory, based solely on the smallness of the vibration amplitude, is not applicable. Then a linearization technique, correct to the first order of the vibration amplitude, is introduced and the case of strong-absorber vibrations is solved correctly. The results are interpreted and compared with those given by the weak-absorber approximation, whereby a close functional similarity is found. Finally, applicability of the latter is examined numerically and deviation from the exact results is found to be small in realistic situations.},

  abstract = {The validity of the use of the diffusion approximation in neutron noise theory is investigated through a comparison with P1 theory. The motivation comes from the fact that both static and dynamic perturbations act as non-isotropic sources in the P1 expansion of the static angular flux and the angular noise, respectively, and the neglection of these terms, which would allow the use of diffusion theory, is not obvious. In addition, the effect of noise sources that affect primarily the scattering cross section (diffusion coefficient) has not been the subject of a thorough investigation before. The P1 theory of static and dynamic perturbations is developed in this paper and the results show the corrections introduced by P1 theory. It is found that for cases when the fluctuation of the absorption cross section dominates, the quantitative difference between the diffusion and P1 theory results is negligible in general. For cases when the perturbation leads to the fluctuation of the scattering cross section only, such as in cases of density fluctuations in a heavy water moderator or even a small light water reactor, P1 theory needs to be used and the results differ markedly from the noise induced by an equivalent absorption cross section fluctuation in diffusion theory. Some concrete cases are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

Then the point kinetic component of the noise is derived from the full space-frequency dependent solution in an analytical form by a projection to the static adjoint. The solution of the simplified point kinetic equations and the linearly exact point kinetic component obtained by the projection technique are compared quantitatively and it is shown that the solution of the simplified point kinetic equations cannot reconstruct some important features of the true solution. {\'O} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The Green's function of the system is investigated in the general case of arbitrary fuel recirculation velocity and in the limiting case of infinite fuel velocity, which permits closed-form solutions in both the static and dynamic cases. It is found that the amplitude of the induced noise is generally higher and the domain of the point kinetic behavior valid up to higher frequencies than in a corresponding traditional system. This is due to the differing behavior of the delayed neutron precursors as compared to the traditional case. The MSR equations are not self-adjoint and the adjoint equation and adjoint function have to be constructed, which is also done here. Finally, the space-dependent neutron noise, induced by propagating perturbations of the absorption cross section, is calculated. A number of interesting properties that are relevant to full-size MSRs are found and interpreted. The results are consistent with those in traditional systems, but the domains of various behavior regimes (point kinetic, space dependent, etc.) are shifted to higher frequencies or system sizes.},

However, most of the investigations reported so far concern the determination of the ES itself either from static calculations, or from measurements of the flux tilt or neutron noise crosscorrelations. Conclusions on system behaviour were only drawn from the properties of the static eigenfunctions, comparing non-perturbed and perturbed systems, without explicitly solving the time- or frequency-dependent problem. In this paper, we explore the role of the ES on the neutronic response of a critical core to small stochastic perturbations (neutron noise); in particular, the spatial and frequency characteristics of the arising neutron noise as a function of the ES, as well as the spatial structure of the perturbation. It is shown that for systems with small ES and non-uniform perturbations, point kinetics will not dominate even for very low frequencies. The results lend some further insight into the origin and properties of the various types of boiling water reactor instabilities.},

Because of these differences, there has been known no joint or unified description, based on first principles rather than empirical analogies, that treats a case when both types of noise are present concurrently. The subject of the present paper is to develop a unified theory of zero power and power reactor noise by calculating the probability distribution of the neutrons in a core with fluctuating material properties. A backward type master equation formalism is used with point kinetics, and the fluctuating cross-sections are represented by a binary pseudorandom process. A closed form solution is obtained which is significantly more complicated than the cases of zero power noise or power reactor noise separately, which are also given in the paper. It is shown that the general solution contains both the zero power and power reactor noise in the sense that the two forms can be extracted individually as limiting cases of the general solution.},

Additionally, metrics for evaluating the accuracy of the temperature distribution are presented that are motivated both from the fields of traditional signal processing and statistics. The performance of a method based on matching pursuits is compared to a method that uses the sequential ordering of basis functions. The matching pursuits-based method gives improved performance for highly sparse representations of temperature distributions. Additionally, accuracy is analyzed for multiple temperature distributions which represent different potential reactor operation configurations. Overall, the results from this work should be considered as an upper bound on the performance of basis projection methods which employ generalized basis functions for real time reactor control.},

  abstract = {This work presents a novel and modern method for reactor modeling, simulation, and uncertainty characterization through an integrated framework developed under the terminology of combining four fundamental principles in scientific modeling and computing: Physics, Models, Data, and UQ (Uncertainty Quantification). The framework houses various physical phenomena that occur inside nuclear reactors, such as neutronics, reactor kinetics, fuel depletion, thermal-hydraulics, and fuel performance as well as outside the reactor such as spent fuel and criticality safety. The framework utilizes various computer models in the nuclear area, which are already validated and known to provide accurate results. The framework is supported and validated by a wide range of experimental data from different single and multiphysics experiments, such as delayed neutron data, void fraction measurements, isotopic composition, nuclear data, and others. Many computational models to simulate the actual physical phenomena are developed under this framework, which vary in their complexity from a simple 2D pin-cell to a complex 3D lattice model with multiphysics coupling. Additionally, the framework is built based upon a wide range of mathematical and statistical methods featuring different areas such as sensitivity analysis, variance decomposition, dimensionality analysis and reduction, reduced order modeling, machine learning, data science, deep learning, Monte Carlo and deterministic uncertainty propagation, Bayesian statistics, correlation analysis, and data assimilation. All efforts in this thesis are expected to yield a better understanding of nuclear reactor simulations, which in turn can lead to improved performance, safety, and reduced costs for nuclear industry. Within this thesis, many frameworks, platforms, and models are developed to support the master framework. An integrated UQ approach is developed through the Bayesian framework, which handles various forms of uncertainty in scientific modeling such as parametric, experimental, predictive, interpolation, and model-form uncertainty. The methodology is useful to account for various uncertainty sources in nuclear computer models. This integrated UQ methodology can also be used for model selection of different physical models, through evaluating them against real data. The methodology is applied in this thesis to nuclear thermal-hydraulics and two-phase flow codes to quantify their predictive and model-form uncertainties. Data science methods are a core part of the framework. Machine learning methods are integrated to alleviate the computational burden of the complex simulations to construct cheap-to-evaluate reduced order or surrogate models. Modern deep learning methods form a major part of this thesis to analyze complex datasets resulting from the advanced simulations generated using the master framework. These machine and deep learning models are tested using real-world and benchmarked nuclear simulations with different underlying physics, from fundamental nuclear data to nuclear fuel performance. Data-driven models are constructed using simulation and experimental data to perform uncertainty propagation, surrogate modeling, model validation, and variance decomposition. Development of a new precursor-group kinetics framework is done to propagate the uncertainty into reactor kinetic parameters due to the fundamental nuclear and delayed neutron data. Coupling of single physics processes (e.g. neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, fuel performance) to form more realistic multiphysics simulations is also accomplished through FUSE platform. FUSE is verified through two test cases of two-way coupled neutronics-thermal-hydraulics and neutronics-fuel performance simulations. Spent fuel analysis and criticality safety frameworks are built as a validation object to assess the accuracy of the framework modeling approaches. The spent fuel composition discharged from the reactor core is assessed in the spent fuel cask to determine the overall system safety. A comprehensive application of the spent fuel framework on BWR spent fuel is carried out in this thesis. All the physics, data, methods, and frameworks are integrated into the master framework developed in this thesis. The major achievements of the framework developed to the nuclear area include: a set of kinetic parameters' values and uncertainties for light water reactor systems, advanced depletion models for accurate burnup credit of BWR, integrated assessment and advanced UQ of nuclear computer models, a platform for nuclear multiphysics simulations, and building deep learning models for high dimensional UQ purposes. Most of the methods and the frameworks developed here are extendable to other problems outside the nuclear area. The reader is strongly recommended to read the first chapter of this thesis as it will provide directions to efficiently access the whole document. The first chapter presents an executive summary of the work done over the whole thesis. This thesis is published in several peer-reviewed articles in premier conferences and journals specialized in nuclear engineering, system safety, uncertainty quantification, and energy resources. A summary of the framework developed in this thesis is published in Radaideh and Kozlowski (2019b).},

  abstract = {Fractional neutron point kinetics (FNPK) model has been known for some researchers in the field of nuclear science and engineering for less than a decade. This modeling has a better approximation and physical interpretation for some phenomena, specially, when large variations of neutron cross sections occur and the dynamic behavior of neutron is different. This paper, for the first time, presents a fractional neutron point kinetics model which consists of three delayed neutron groups and the reactivity feedback effects (temperature feedbacks and poison feedbacks). Also, Stability Analysis of linear FNPK model considering reactivity feedback effects for a Research Nuclear Reactor is done. The model has been linearized around the equilibrium operating point. Then, the closed-loop linear fractional neutron point kinetics model considering reactivity feedback effects is transformed from S-domain to W-domain. For stability evaluation, two strategies have been implemented. The first strategy is the assessment of the region of closed-loop poles in the principal Riemann sheet (PRS) for the transformed system. The second one is the step response evaluation of the linear fractional-order closed-loop model for different values of the model parameters (including relaxation times and anomalous diffusion coefficients). Simulation results demonstrate that the stability of the system depends on the values of these model parameters and for one scenario, the closed-loop poles are located in the unstable region of PRS and the step response is unstable. However, for the others, it is stable and settles at an equilibrium value. In addition, a smaller anomalous diffusion coefficient ({$\alpha$}), leads to a more unstable closed-loop model (have poles closer or inside the unstable region). Comparative analysis is shown that reactivity feedback effects are considerable on the stability of the research nuclear reactor. Specially, feedback by xenon has a negative effect on the stability and reduces the stability of system. Also, the stability highly depends on the values of {$\alpha$} and {$\tau$}.},

  abstract = {Low-frequency neutronic noise with magnitudes of up to ten percent of the reactor power have been observed in Konvoi-type PWR in Germany in the last years. Several attempts were made to identify the reasons for increased magnitudes of the neutronic fluctuations in comparison with pre-Konvoi reactors, and various hypotheses have been created to explain this effect. In this paper, results of noise simulations performed with use of the reactor dynamics code DYN3D are presented. Fluctuations of the coolant inlet temperature and mass flow rate were considered. Besides of un-correlated fluctuations, correlated temperature fluctuations were simulated. In a preliminary analysis with harmonic temperature oscillations, the importance of existing correlations between temperature fluctuations in the individual fuel assemblies was pointed out. In our analyses, the correlations between fluctuations in the individual fuel assemblies were obtained based on an experimentally validated coolant mixing model. However, the features of the neutronic noise found in the simulations do not correspond to the measurements. Obviously, more complex mechanisms than only temperature and/or mass flow fluctuations have to be considered. Simulated generic fluctuations of the local moderator density, that were introduced independently from thermal hydraulics, indicate that potentially deformations or vibrations of the fuel rod lattice or turbulent fluctuations of the coolant temperature and density inside the fuel rod bundles leading to variations of the local moderator content might be responsible for the observed neutronic noise. Therefore, advanced models coupling neutronics, thermal hydraulics, turbulence and mechanical modelling have to be developed.},

We develop a new Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the transport neutron noise equations in the frequency domain. The stochastic method presented here relies on a modified collision operator and does not need any weight cancellation technique. In this paper, both Monte Carlo methods are compared with deterministic methods (diffusion in a slab geometry and transport in a simplified rod model) for several noise frequencies and for isotropic and anisotropic noise sources. Our stochastic method shows better performances in the frequency region of interest and is easier to implement because it relies upon the conventional algorithm for fixed-source problems.},

In (Aboanber and Nahla, 2016b), Aboanber and Nahla presented an extension of Espinosa-parades et al. FNPK model. This new model is called as the corrected fractional neutron point kinetic (CFNPK) model. The present study is concerned with the numerical solution of the CFNPK model (Aboanber and Nahla, 2016b) with six groups of delayed neutron precursors. The fractional derivative is described in the sense of Gr{\"u}nwald-Letnikov. An implicit finite difference method (FDM) is constructed for the solution of CFNPK model. The stability analysis of the method is carried out. We analyze the results of neutron density for different values of anomalous diffusion order, reactivity function, relaxation time and time step size. In addition, we compare the results corresponding to CFNPK model (Aboanber and Nahla, 2016b) with the results corresponding to the FNPK model proposed by Espinosa-parades et al. (Espinosa-Paredes et al., 2011). It is shown that as anomalous diffusion order decreases or simulation time increases the difference between the values of neutron density increases.

Countries such as the UK, Turkey and emerging economies (i.e. Malaysia and Indonesia) are increasingly seeking to attract private investors for nuclear projects using project finance. This is an innovative approach, and until now the only cases registered are Hinckley Point C in the UK and Akkuyu in Turkey. This paper scrutinises the mismatches between the requirements of project finance and nuclear law. Nuclear law introduces specific requirements affecting the security interest of private lenders, hindering the bankability of nuclear projects on a non-recourse basis. The paper emphasises that the performance-based regulatory approach is more compatible with project finance compared to the prescriptive based one. Furthermore, the paper examines the gaps between nuclear and holistic energy law, looking at the financing of energy infrastructures. Improving nuclear law enables to apply project finance to nuclear power plants, facilitating their deployment. Consequently, nuclear law plays a central role in promoting sustainable energy mixes characterised by reduced carbon emissions.},

  abstract = {Properties of the random noise source, which gives rise to inherent statistical fluctuations in nuclear reactors, have been studied under the assumption that the macrostochastic variables characterizing the state of the nuclear system follow the Markoffian random process. It has been found that the fundamental assumption leads to unified interpretation of phenomenological statements used repeatedly in the previous reactor-noise theory. They are: 1) the Langevin technique is to be applied; 2) the noise source is assumed to be white; 3) the Schottky formula is to be applied to determine the noise spectral density. Furthermore, the importance of the so-called Nyquist theorem is pointed out for establishing the Langevin method.The theorem shows that a generalized Einstein relation holds between the spectral density of the white-noise source and the linear constant operator describing the probable or expected kinetic behavior of nuclear systems. With the use of the relation, the noise spectral density has been classified into the binary and the single component. The latter comes from the fact that various nuclear reactions are of Poissonian nature, and produce the direct correlation term in the neutron field. The term is eliminated in the cross correlation function of the outputs of two detectors. The binary noise component, which comes from the branching processes and contributes to the count-rate fluctuations both for the one- and two-detector system of measurements, contains, however, the covariance of fluctuations of macrostochastic variables as unknowns. The complete determination of the noise source is accomplished with the use of the Smoluchowski consistency condition. The result offers a generalized Schottky formula.As an application, the space- and energy-dependent neutronic noise theory is treated in detail. Delayed neutrons are included from the outset. Applicability of the present theory to a slightly nonlinear system is suggested.},

The objective of this study is experimentally to confirm a high flexibility of neutron detector placement in graphite reflector for reactor noise analysis. The present reactor noise analysis was carried out in a graphite-moderated and -reflected thermal core in Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA). BF3 proportional neutron counters (1'' dia.) were placed in graphite reflector region, where the counters were separated by about 35cm and 30cm -thick graphite from the core, respectively. At a critical state and subcritical states, time-sequence signal data from these counters were acquired and analyzed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyzer, to obtain power spectral density in frequency domain. The auto-power spectral density obtained from the counters far from the core contained a significant degree of correlated component. A least-squares fit of a familiar formula to the auto-power spectral density data was made to determine the prompt-neutron decay constant. The decay constant was 63.3{\textpm}14.5 [1/s] in critical state. The decay constant determined from the cross-power spectral density and coherence function data between the two counters also had a consistent value. It is confirmed that reactor noise analysis is possible using a detector placed at about 35cm far from the core, as we expected.},

We include the description of precursor's motion in the equations and introduce a different perturbation formula based on the time-averaged operator. Among other advantages, the latter results in a robust system of linearized equations that minimize the perturbation component of the flux by setting its time-averaged value to zero. This is in contrast to traditional noise theory whose linearized equations are not robust when the perturbation adds reactivity to the core, which is the case with vibrations. We also introduce a higher-order full diagonal approximation for the noise equations and show that our new perturbation formula yields the only linearized approximation which is equivalent to the full diagonal formulation. Finally, we introduce a new linear model which for vibration-generated noise is closer to the exact noise equations and has potential to give a better solution when the terms not included in the traditional linearized model are greater than O{\dh} 2{\TH}.},

The approach is based on a new framework developed by the authors, which combines PINNs with Theory of Functional Connections and Extreme Learning Machines in the so called Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC). The accuracy of X-TFC is tested against a number of published benchmarks (including for non-linear PKEs), showing its performance both in terms of accuracy and computational time. One of the main advantages of the proposed framework is in its flexibility to adapt to a variety of problems with minimal changes in coding and, after the training of the network, in its ability to offer an analytical representation (by Neural Networks) of the solution at any desired time instant outside the initial discretization.},

  abstract = {A key challenge for the introduction of any design changes, e.g., advanced fuel concepts, first-of-a-kind nuclear reactor designs, etc., is the cost of the associated experiments, which are required by law to validate the use of computer models for the various stages, starting from conceptual design, to deployment, licensing, operation, and safety. To achieve that, a criterion is needed to decide on whether a given experiment, past or planned, is relevant to the application of interest. This allows the analyst to select the best experiments for the given application leading to the highest measures of confidence for the computer model predictions. The state-of-the-art methods rely on the concept of similarity or representativity, which is a linear Gaussian-based inner-product metric measuring the angle---as weighted by a prior model parameters covariance matrix---between two gradients, one representing the application and the other a single validation experiment. This manuscript emphasizes the concept of experimental relevance which extends the basic similarity index to account for the value accrued from past experiments and the associated experimental uncertainties, both currently missing from the extant similarity methods. Accounting for multiple experiments is key to the overall experimental cost reduction by prescreening for redundant information from multiple equally-relevant experiments as measured by the basic similarity index. Accounting for experimental uncertainties is also important as it allows one to select between two different experimental setups, thus providing for a quantitative basis for sensor selection and optimization. The proposed metric is denoted by ACCRUE, short for Accumulative Correlation Coefficient for Relevance of Uncertainties in Experimental validation. Using a number of criticality experiments for highly enriched fast metal systems and low enriched thermal compound systems with accident tolerant fuel concept, the manuscript will compare the performance of the ACCRUE and basic similarity indices for prioritizing the relevance of a group of experiments to the given application.},

The CP method is the most efficient methods to solve the neutron transport equation in the reactor core. The study is focused on neutron interaction with nuclear fuel cell of U-235 and U-238 for homogeneous condition. The parameters to calculate the Pij matrix are the cross section of nuclear fuel, width of the region and number of regions. A lattice of slabs have been constructed using void boundary conditions for model of finite system to calculate the collision probabilities. If the Pij matrix has been calculated then neutron flux can be determined. The results show that total value of Pij matrix using CP method for U-235 and U-238 is less than one, respectively. This is in accordance with the definition of void boundary conditions for finite slab geometry. Along with Pij matrix, neutron flux is also appropriate with the reference.},

There are also discussion on the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to a few major renewable energy projects that should have been done in 2020-2021. Comprising of 14 chapters, this book is divided into three sections. The first part, Indonesia's Current Position and Strategy for Renewable Energy, explores Indonesia's current position and strategy on New and Renewable Energy. This chapter also explores Indonesia's commitment towards Net-Zero Carbon Emission 2060. Second, Carbon-Free and Renewable Energy in Indonesia, discusses the status of renewable energy use in the world, elaborate on the carbon impact of energy shift from fossil to renewable sources, and introduce a new criterion in renewable energy: carbon-neutral energy. The last part, Indonesia's New Strategy to Achieve Net-Zero Emission in 2060, explores the macroeconomic benefits of renewable and carbon-neutral energy deployment which are increasing energy security, fueling GDP development, creating job opportunities, enhancing human welfare, and achieving gender equality. We hope that this book can be a valuable reference for stakeholders, policymakers, as well as society to recover from the pandemic crisis and find better solutions to benefit future generations.},

In this type of event there is a distortion in the power distribution in the core which may exceed safe operating limits of the reactor. This work aims to develop an alternative model capable of detecting an inadvertent drop event of a control rod and then identifying it using the in-core and ex-core nuclear instrumentation. The proposed model has two stages: The first aims to detect in an online form the inadvertent drop of a control rod at the core through the readings of the ex-core detectors and the second is to identify the dropped control rod through the in-core detectors readings, using a Delaunay triangulation method. The results showed that it is possible to detect the event of a control rod drop using an established limit on the asymmetry of the radial power distribution measured by ex-core detectors and the identification method of dropped control rod depends exclusively of the in-core nuclear instrumentation readings, because it is based on a physical premise that higher power variations occur in the position where the control rod is inserted and its surroundings.},

  abstract = {Most basic models for the power (or equivalently, the neutron population) in a nuclear core consider the power as a function of time (with an energetic and spatial distribution) and lead to deterministic description of the reactor kinetics. While these models are of common use and are undoubtedly the main analytic tool in understanding the reactor kinetics, the true nature of the power in a reactor core is stochastic and should be considered as a stochastic process in time. The stochastic fluctuations of the power around the mean field (which is given by the deterministic models) are referred to as ``reactor noise'', and understanding them is a basic topic in nuclear science and engineering. Traditionally, most models for reactor noise consider a sub-critical core, reaching steady state after exposure to an external source. The focus on a sub-critical setting is driven by two main factors. First, from a practical point of view, measuring the power fluctuations in a sub-critical core (known as ``noise experiments'') has proven to be a very efficient tool for estimating the static and kinetic parameters of the core. Second, once we assume a critical setting, the current models become statistically unstable, while the mean field solution has a stationary solution, the variance tends to {$\infty$} linearly in time. The instability of the stochastic models is a known problem, and it has been conjectured in the past that this (some what strange) increase in the variance---that is not observed in physical systems---can be restrained by power feedback. However, this conjecture was never proven. The outline of the present study is to present a stochastic analysis to the point reactor kinetics model, proving that once the reactivity has a negative feedback, it not only forces a specific steady-state solution (in terms of the mean field equation), but also prevents the variance to ``explode'', and the variance is bounded in time.},

  abstract = {KWU pre-Konvoi PWRs (SIEMENS design) are commonly exhibiting high neutron noise levels which can lead to costly operational issues (i.e. activation of SCRAM system, operation of unrated core power, etc.). The frequency region of interest of neutron noise is below 1\,Hz, which is the typical frequency range of thermal-hydraulic phenomena. This feature seems to indicate that, coolant flow and temperature oscillations can have a key impact on neutron noise phenomena. Moreover, an increasing neutron noise trend (in term of normalized root mean square) was recently observed in many KWU-PWRs. This increasing trend has been speculated to be correlated with the introduction of a new fuel design type in the KWU-PWRs. This fact indicates that there should be some correlation between neutron noise spectral characteristics and fuel assemblies' performance. In order to advance in understanding this phenomenon, the transient nodal code SIMULATE-3K (S3K) has been used to simulate mechanical vibrations of fuel assemblies and thermal-hydraulic fluctuations of the core inlet flow and temperature. The simulated neutron detectors responses are analysed with noise analysis techniques and compared to real plant data. This analysis indicates that the cross-feedback between the mechanical and thermal-hydraulic disturbances complicate the identification of the origin of the perturbation source. The simulated results indicate that the neutron noise spectral characteristics can be associated separately to different causes. In this sense, the results of this work seem to indicate that the spectral features of the neutron noise are a consequence of both mechanical perturbations and thermal-hydraulic fluctuations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the development of a neutronic and kinetic solver for neutron noise calculations in hexagonal geometries. The tool is developed based on diffusion theory with multienergy groups and several groups of delayed neutron precursors allowing the solutions of forward and adjoint problems of static and dynamic states. The tool is applicable to both thermal and fast systems with hexagonal geometries. In the dynamic problems, the small stationary fluctuations of macroscopic cross sections are considered as noise sources, then the induced first-order noise is solved fully in the frequency domain. Numerical algorithms for solving the static and noise equations are implemented using finite differences for spatial discretization and a power iterative solution. A coarse-mesh finite difference technique for accelerating the convergence has been adopted. Verification calculations have been performed and compared to analytical solutions based on a two-dimensional homogeneous system with two energy groups and one group of delayed neutron precursors, in which pointlike perturbations of thermal absorption cross section at central and noncentral positions are considered as noise sources.},

  abstract = {A variant of the Green's function nodal method derived from the boundary integral form of the multigroup neutron diffusion equation in rectangular geometry is presented. As usual in the nodal methods, the multi-dimensional diffusion equation is integrated in the transverse direction. The resulting 1D diffusion equation is solved following the Boundary Element technique in one dimension. In this way a weighted residual method is obtained, with a Green's function for weighting, but with different boundary conditions than normally applied in the Green's function nodal methods. Mathematical formulation of the method is given and the iteration procedure is described. A computer program BINDIF has been designed, based on the new method. Its capabilities include the solution of the multigroup neutron diffusion equation of 1D, 2D and 3D rectangular lattices. The BINDIF program has been checked against other methods used for global reactor calculations on benchmark problems, representative of realistic power reactor cores. The results indicate that the method is attractive to design highly efficient algorithms for a large mainframe, a personal computer or a parallel processor.},

The aims of the temperature noise measurements were to determine the subchannel coolant velocities behind the blockage to study the mixing of coolant in subchannels of different temperature from behind the blockage to the outlet and to study the temperature noise due to boiling in a subchannel. The temperature noise measurements were carried out in parallel to the other measurements (temperature distribution, etc.), using signals of fourteen subchannel thermocouples placed in five measuring planes behind the blockage. The single phase measurements were made with several heat fluxes (5 W/cm2 to 120 W/cm2), inlet flows (0.25 to 3 m/s) and inlet temperatures (250{$^\circ$}C to 600{$^\circ$}C). Two phase flow is initiated and sustained either by a slow and continuous pressure reduction or by stepwise reduction of the main flow. The temperature noise signals were amplified and recorded in analog form. Later the signals were digitized and analysed by digital computers. Part of the signals was also processed by a hardware correlator. The experimental results of the temperature noise measurements will be shown for the different conditions of the loop. Measurements clearly show the following effects: \&\#x02022;- the recirculation flow pattern due to the vortex in the wake behind the blockage;\&\#x02022;- the dependence of r.m.s. value of the noise on the heat flux and the coolant flow;\&\#x02022;- the increase in noise and change in power spectra when going from single phase to the boiling condition.},

  abstract = {Mechanical vibrations of core internals are among the main perturbations that induce oscillations in the neutron flux field, also known as neutron noise. In this work, different simulation models for the study of the influence of the mechanical vibrations of fuel assemblies on the neutron flux in the reactor core have been discussed. These methodologies employ the diffusion approximation, with or without a previous homogenization model, to simulate the neutron noise in the time or the frequency domain. The diffusion-based approach is expected to be less accurate in the vicinity of the vibrating fuel assemblies, but correct when considering distances larger than a few diffusion lengths away from the perturbation. All methodologies provide consistent results and can reproduce typical features of the neutron noise induced by mechanical vibrations of core components. First, FEMFFUSION can perform simulations in both the time and frequency domains. Second, CORE SIM~+~can be used to study various neutron noise scenarios in realistic three-dimensional reactor configurations. The third methodology is centred on using commercial codes as CASMO-5, SIMULATE-3 and SIMULATE-3K. This methodology allows time domain simulations of the neutron noise induced by different neutron noise sources in a nuclear reactor. Finally, a model for time-dependent geometry is implemented for the code system ATHLET/QUABOX-CUBBOX employing a cross-section-based approach for encoding water gap width variations at the reflector.},

Investigating the signal fluctuations of these detectors at fixed burnup, periods of growing and periods of decreasing fluctuation amplitudes can be found, a phenomenon that is not entirely explained. Respecting the phenomenology of measured neutron noise data as well as of simulation results from the reactor-dynamics code DYN3D, the model hypothesis formulated here is a first attempt to couple low-frequency, collective fuel assembly deflections to power reactor noise: pressure fluctuations dynamically drive fuel assembly deflections, which alter the position of the common center of mass of all fuel assemblies; the center of mass fluctuations drive fluctuating changes of the reflector thickness and, thus, induce long-range dynamical effects on the neutron flux. As one detail, the proposed model states that a lowered lateral fuel assembly stiffness results in an increase of the neutron flux fluctuation amplitudes and vice versa. For testing this hypothesis, the model has been coupled to DYN3D. The signal analysis of the results obtained with the modified DYN3D indicates that the proposed model may explain the phenomenon of increasing and decreasing neutron flux fluctuation amplitudes. Steps for further modelling are proposed.},

Among the numerical tools used to investigate the neutron flux fluctuations is the time-domain reactor dynamics code DYN3D. As DYN3D and comparable codes have not been developed with the primary intention to simulate low-amplitude neutron flux fluctuations, their applicability in this field has to be verified. In order to contribute to the verification of DYN3D for the simulation of neutron flux fluctuations, two special cases of perturbations of the neutron flux (a localized absorber of variable/oscillatory strength and a travelling oscillatory perturbation) are considered with DYN3D on the one hand and with the frequency-domain neutron noise tool CORE SIM as well as analytical frequency-domain approaches, respectively, on the other hand. The obtained results are compared with respect to the distributions of the amplitude and the phase of the induced neutron flux fluctuations. The comparisons are repeated with varied amplitudes and frequencies of the perturbation. The results agree well both qualitatively and quantitatively for each of the conducted calculations.

  abstract = {Vibrations of fuel assemblies are an important issue in the safe operation of nuclear reactors, because they can challenge the integrity of the fuel with potential for radioactive releases. Reactor neutron noise-based techniques for monitoring vibrations are valuable for core diagnostic since they are not intrusive and make use of ordinary neutron flux measurements from ex-core and in-core detectors. The application of these techniques involves the solution of inverse problems that require numerical simulations capable of estimating the reactor neutron noise, given a model of the vibrations. For this purpose, several novel reactor neutron noise solvers have been developed in the CORTEX project using either Monte Carlo or deterministic methods, such as the discrete ordinates method, the method of characteristics, and the diffusion approximation. In the current work, these solvers have been scrutinized by computing the neutron noise induced by vibrations of one or multiple fuel pins in a simplified UOX fuel assembly benchmark, via proper variations of macroscopic neutron cross sections. The comparison of these neutron noise solutions obtained from the different methods shows novel insights into the simulation of neutron noise induced by mechanical vibrations, such as the challenges posed by the Monte Carlo method, the impact of the angular discretization on the application of the discrete ordinates method, and the accuracy of the diffusion approximation assessed via the higher-order neutron transport methods.},

This phenomenon, known as FA bowing, has significant implications for reactor safety and operation. Bowing results in alterations to the spacing between FAs, which in turn leads to neutron flux perturbations affecting power distribution. These perturbations are time-dependent due to variations in boric acid concen\- tration during the cycle. Neutron noise theory is employed to analyze these time-dependent neutron perturba\- tions. In this research, it is investigated the bowing effect during the cycle in a VVER-1000 reactor using the neutron noise adiabatic approximation. It was initially considered a VVER-1000 reactor core to verify the cal\- culations algorithm without bowed FAs. Results had acceptable accuracy in power, initial boric acid, and cycle length. Subsequently, it was explored various modes of FA bowing as neutron noise sources the results revealed that the power noise caused by bowing varies throughout the cycle, as expected. The noise amplitude during the cycle depends on changes in boric acid concentration, burnup, size, and the direction of bowing.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the theoretical and practical application of the finite element method to the neutron transport equation. The theoretical examination which is applicable to the general transport equation in arbitrary geometry includes a derivation of the equivalent integral law (or weak form) of the first order neutron trans\- port equation, to which the finite element method (Galerkin approach) is applied, resulting in a system of algebraic equations. We show that in principle the system of equations can be solved with certain physical restrictions concerning the criticality of the medium. The convergence of this approximate solution {\textasciitilde}o the exact solution with mesh refinement is examined, and a non-optimal estimate of the convergence rate is ob\- tained analytically. It is noted that the numerical results indicate a faster convergence rate and several approaches to obtain this result analytically are outlined. The practical application of the finite element method involved the development of a computer code capable of solving the neutron transport equation in l-D plane geometry. Vacuum, reflecting, or specified in\- coming boundary conditions may be analyzed, and all are treated as nat\- ural boundary conditions. The incorporation of the reflecting boundary conditi ons is seen to result in an ambiguity, whi ch must be resol ved b consideration of the direction in which neutrons travel. Discontinuous phase space finite elements are introduced, and it is seen that discontin- . uous angular elements effectively match the analytical discontinuities in the angular flux atA,= 0 for plane geometry. In addition, the use of discontinuous spatial elements is shown to result in treating contin\- uity of the angular flux at an interface as-a natural interface condition in the direction of neutron travel. The time-dependent transport. equation is also examined and it is shown that the application of the finite element method in conjunction . with the Crank-Nicholson time discretization method results in a system of algebraic equations which is readily solved. Numerical results are given for several critical slab eigenvalue problems, including anisotropic scatter"ing, and the results compare ex\- tremeTy well with benchmark results. It is seen that the finite element code is more efficient than a standard discrete ordinates code for cer\- tain problems. Precise numerical tests are made on the convergence rate of the approximate solution (L2 norm) with mesh refinement and also with the eigenvalue error. These results indicate O(h k+l ) solution error in the L2 norm and O(h 2k+l ) error in the eigenvalue, where h is the mesh spacing and k the degree of the finite element. A problem with severe heterogeneities is considered and it is shown that the use of discon\- tinuous spatial and angular elements results in a marked improvement in the results. Finally, time-dependent problems are examined and it is seen that the phenomenon of angular mode separation makes the numerical treatment of the transport equation "in slab geometry a considerable challenge, with the result that the angular mesh has a dominant effect on obtaining acceptable solutions to thetime-depeRdent transport equation.},

Unfortunately, the required optimization problem is often intractable because there is a combinatorial increase in the number of local minima as the number of candidate basis vectors increases. This deficiency has prompted most researchers to instead minimize surrogate measures, such as the {$\ell$}1-norm, that lead to more tractable computational methods. The downside of this procedure is that we have now introduced a mismatch between our ultimate goal and our objective function. In this paper, we demonstrate a sparse Bayesian learning-based method of minimizing the {$\ell$}0-norm while reducing the number of troublesome local minima. Moreover, we derive necessary conditions for local minima to occur via this approach and empirically demonstrate that there are typically many fewer for general problems of interest.},

  abstract = {Interest in circulating fuel reactors (CFRs), particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs) of the fluid fuel type, has been growing in the last two decades. Starting with a resurgence of interest in Europe, there have been a growing number of methods proposed and codes developed to model the kinetics of CFRs, which is a capability essential to the design and evaluation of such reactors. This work first reviews the physical phenomena unique to CFRs in light of current research and how CFR kinetics are impacted by these considerations. In general, it is found that the movement of delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) through the primary loop has significant impacts on transients at low reactor powers or those with significant spatial components such as a change in the primary loop mass flow rate. Effects on the neutron flux are exceedingly minimal and entirely negligible. An extensive review of published models and methods for simulating CFR kinetics is presented, along with transient simulations in fast and thermal neutron flux systems using representative codes from each of the main modeling categories. Comparisons among methods are presented as are recommendations for their use or nonuse in various transient and work-flow scenarios. In general, it is recommended that time-resolved, multigroup neutron diffusion approaches be used to establish ranges of applicability for point reactor kinetics (PRK)--based approaches that themselves may not be applicable for all modeling situations. In such cases, it is suggested that quasi-static approaches be used where PRK-based approaches cannot be used. Finally, a review of common assumptions used in these models is presented, along with an evaluation of their impact on model performance. It is found that neglecting turbulent diffusion in open core--type CFRs is a poor assumption that leads to an underestimation of the reduction of the delayed neutron fraction. Additionally, it is seen that exclusion of secondary heat transfer loops in models leads to underestimation of transient peaks and troughs.},

The goal of this paper is to understand what choices of the regularization parameter can dictate the level of sparsity under the transform for a global minimizer of the resulting regularized objective function. This is a critical issue but it has been left unaddressed. We address it from a geometric viewpoint with which the sparsity partition of the image space of the transform is introduced. Choices of the regularization parameter are specified to ensure that a global minimizer of the corresponding regularized objective function achieves a prescribed level of sparsity under the transform. Results are obtained for the spacial sparsity case in which the transform is the identity map, a case that covers several applications of practical importance, including machine learning, image/signal processing and medical image reconstruction.},

The amplitude and the phase shift of the higher-order mode components have a minor dependence on the frequency, compared to the fundamental mode. Near the neutron noise source, the higher-order mode components account for a major portion of the neutron noise, thereby causing a minor dependence of the neutron noise on the frequency. Near the nodes of the higher-order modes, the fundamental mode is dominant, and the neutron noise exhibits almost the point kinetics behavior. The space dependence and the frequency characteristics of the neutron noise are elucidated by examining the higher order components that are decomposed from the neutron noise distribution.},

In this paper, the neutron noise is defined as the stationary fluctuation of the neutron flux around its mean value, and is induced by perturbations of the macroscopic cross sections. Since the transport equation of the neutron noise is a complex equation, a Monte Carlo technique for treating complex-valued weights that was recently proposed for neutron leakage-corrected calculations has been introduced to solve the complex equation. To cancel the positive and negative values of complex-valued weights, an algorithm that is similar to the power iteration method has been implemented. The newly-developed Monte Carlo algorithm is benchmarked to analytical solutions in an infinite homogeneous medium. The neutron noise spatial distributions have been obtained both with the newly-developed Monte Carlo method and the conventional diffusion method for an infinitely-long homogeneous cylinder. The results with the Monte Carlo method agree well with those of the diffusion method. However, near the noise source induced by a high frequency perturbation, significant differences are found between the diffusion method and Monte Carlo method. The newly-developed Monte Carlo algorithm is expected to contribute to the improvement of calculation accuracy of the neutron noise.},

For this purpose, the solver NOISE-SN is developed and used to simulate two neutron noise problems that are respectively derived from the two-dimensional systems described in the neutron transport simulation benchmarks C4V and C5G7. In the first problem based on the C4V system, NOISE-SN is compared to the diffusion-based simulator CORE SIM+. These results show that NOISE-SN and CORE SIM+ calculate similar spatial distributions of neutron noise, although significant differences can be found at the location of the perturbation and at locations with strong variations of material properties, where the discrete ordinates method is expected to be more accurate than diffusion theory. Then NOISE-SN calculations are performed to test different SN approximations, and the fictitious source method that may be applied to mitigate possible numerical artifacts, known as the ray effect. In the second problem based on the C5G7 system, the choice of a low order of discrete ordinates in NOISE-SN leads to unphysical values of the neutron noise because of the ray effect. The increase of the order of discrete ordinates or introducing a fictitious source in the equations to be solved alleviates the issue. The second option is shown to remove the ray effect without a high order of discrete ordinates and thus without too expensive calculations, even though the strength of the fictitious source needs to be tuned carefully to avoid very slow convergence rates.},

  abstract = {Previous work done on reactor kinetics and control in load-following operation modes available in open literature is reviewed. The analysis is focused on, however not limited to pressurized water reactors. Different approximations of the time-dependent neutron transport problem as well as different control algorithms are described in detail and compared. Due to lack of published information the majority of the comparisons was done on qualitative level. In order to facilitate future testing and intercomparisons of models and algorithms, two so-called reference scenarios with time-dependent power demand are defined: a scenario to test the limitations of the load-following capabilities of the nuclear facilities and a second, quasi-realistic scenario.},

These equations are widely applied to nuclear system numerical simulation and nuclear power plant operational control. This paper analyzes the characteristics of ten different basic or normal methods to solve the point reactor neutron kinetics equations. The accuracy after introducing different kinds of reactivity, stiffness of methods, and computational efficiency are analyzed. The calculation results show that: considering both the accuracy and stiffness, implicit Runge--Kutta method and Hermite method are more suitable for solution on these given conditions. The explicit Euler method is the fastest, while the power series method spends the most computational time.},

  abstract = {Liquid-fuel reactors offer very fascinating problems in neutronics due to the effects of the fuel movements in the reactor core and loop. In the present study, a spatial kinetic model taking the fuel flow effects into account for liquid-fuel reactors is derived without approximation from the timeespacedependent equations of neutrons and delayed neutron precursors. The relation between such spatial kinetic model and the point kinetic model for the solid-fuel reactor is set up as well, which is useful for extending the safety codes developed for conventional solid-fuel reactors to liquid-fuel ones. The spatial kinetic model together with the other two approximated kinetic models are applied to the safety analysis of a typical liquid-fuel reactor MOSART (MOlten Salt Actinide Recycler and Transmuter). The steady state calculation and the ULOF (Unprotected Loss of Flow) calculation are performed, and the liquid-fuel flow effects are studied particularly. The steady state results show that the fuel flow influences the distributions of the delayed neutron precursors significantly. The ULOF results by all models show that the behavior of the relative power, fuel salt temperature, graphite temperature, and reactivity feedbacks are similar due to strong negative reactivity feedbacks. However, the developed spatial kinetic model obtains more safety margin to the fuel temperature limit.},

  abstract = {To assess the accuracy of diffusion or transport methods for reactor calculations, it is desirable to create heterogeneous benchmark problems that are typical of whole core configurations. In this paper we have created two and three dimensional numerical benchmark problems typical of high temperature gas cooled prismatic cores. Additionally, a single cell and single block benchmark problems are also included. These problems were derived from the HTTR start-up experiment. Since the primary utility of the benchmark problems is in code-to-code verification, minor details regarding geometry and material specification of the original experiment have been simplified while retaining the heterogeneity and the major physics properties of the core from a neutronics viewpoint. A six-group material (macroscopic) cross section library has been generated for the benchmark problems using the lattice depletion code HELIOS. Using this library, Monte Carlo solutions are presented for three configurations (all-rods-in, partially-controlled and all-rods-out) for both the 2D and 3D problems. These solutions include the core eigenvalues, the block (assembly) averaged fission densities, local peaking factors, the absorption densities in the burnable poison and control rods, and pin fission density distribution for selected blocks. Also included are the solutions for the single cell and single block problems.},

  abstract = {The investigation of neutron noise is key to several applications in nuclear reactor physics, such as the detection of control rod or assembly vibrations and the diagnostic of coolant speed and void fraction. In this paper we will elucidate some aspects of the noise equations in the Fourier domain, for the case of periodic fuel rod vibrations with frequency x0 in a small symmetrical system in which the perturbation is centrally located. We will in particular focus on the double frequency effect, i.e., the emergence of a noise component at 2x0 (possibly stronger than the one at the fundamental frequency x0). Our analysis will be carried out without truncating the noise source at the first order and in the context of a nonperturbative approach (i.e., without resorting to linearization). For this purpose, we will select a simple benchmark configuration that is amenable to accurate reference solutions obtained by solving the exact time-dependent transport equations. The analysis carried out in this work suggests that the nonperturbative noise equations are mandatory in order to properly discriminate the possible emergence of double frequency effects in neutron noise, especially in view of comparing simulation results to experimental data.},
